![Susan and her husband Nick](/assets/images/about.jpg "Susan and her husband Nick")

Welcome! I'm Susan, just a normal gal born & bred in Cincinnati, OH. Currently, I’m still living in the queen city with my [husband](http://nicolasscott.com/) and our [golden retriever](https://www.instagram.com/captainfitz_/) while working to help brands solve meaningful problems for consumers. Simply put, this website is my outlet for all things on my mind. Expect to see photos I’ve taken, hear about books I’m reading, projects I'm working on, and a little bit of my daily life just for kicks.

Thanks for stopping by!
