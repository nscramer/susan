<p>Hiya! </p>
<p>It's no secret that I have a bit of an obsession with YouTube. It started with finding funny and silly videos to send my friends as a break from work or to liven up a rather dull weekday evening. I eventually stumbled into a beauty vlogger, by the name of e<em>ssiebutton</em>. My eyes were split wide open! I have been a closet makeup-obsessor for so long, thinking that I would come off as too girly or high maintenance if I showed anyone my true colors(....of lipstick, eyeshadow, blush, etc.) </p>
<p>After watching essiebutton for a while (and of course becoming hooked on her second channel, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChl-lOZZY2vo_Zho6cfj0uQ">essiebuttonvlogs</a>), I discovered a whole world of people expressing who they are and their passions to the whole world. I am fascinated by this. Blogging is one thing. It takes courage, persistence, and honesty. But to be on camera <em>damn near all the time</em> is so brave! Not to mention that these ladies (and gentlemen) become <em>amazing </em>photographers and film editors. I mean, to find something you enjoy (whether it be beauty, fashion, books, whatever) and find a way to share it with the world, collecting the skills you need to succeed along the way? THAT'S THE DREAM, PEOPLE. <br>Many of these ladies <em>also</em> have blogs! (will link everything below) Their awesomeness just keeps on growing. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I became hooked, and I am still hooked. Here's some gals that I watch religiously and strongly suggest you do as well. <br>(in no particular order)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFyPrPVotqsTlqxUmAOYRw">Essiebutton</a><br>Estee is quirky, funny, and so completely down to earth. She may or may not be my spirit animal. She's got the cutest greyhound named Reggie, and talks her viewers through many-a-makeup-tutorials, her latest fashions, and what products she's loving. When i'm feeling like I need a laugh, or a little jazz up to my normal makeup routine that won't be too in your face, I find my way to one of her many wonderful videos. <br>Estee's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.essiebutton.com/">http://www.essiebutton.com/</a> </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyfryZQsoN_ttLFe6vYKmw">Heyclaire</a><br>Probably the coolest chick around. She lives in LA, rocks some of the best hair i've ever seen, and gets real about beauty products that work and don't. She also does vlog style videos, and is a bomb-a$$ photog. <br>Claire's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.heyclaire.com/">http://www.heyclaire.com/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCooQN8b9yPeNQgUFa9S5xew">Thebeautycrush</a><br>Sammi from the beauty crush was the second gal I started watching on YouTube. She's hilarious, and so, so real with her viewers. She does amazing makeup tutorials and fashion videos, but also puts out some great advice videos for other gals that can relate! She's got some cute pups of her own, as well! <br>Sammi's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beautycrush.co.uk/">http://www.beautycrush.co.uk/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCth3krFQiaXe7vV-i79a9zg">Viviannadoesmakeup</a><br>Anna is another soul sister of mine. Lover of the minimal look for everyday that gets a bit of a twist now and then and changes often. Just because you love minimal makeup doesn't mean you can't change it up! She also has a wardrobe that pretty much mirrors mine, monochromatic with a host of pretty, flowy tops. "Her get ready with me" videos are some of my favorites. <br>Anna's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.viviannadoesmakeup.com/">http://www.viviannadoesmakeup.com/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO89DCjRd7tt5-yLmRUXKg">Lily Pebbles</a><br>Lily is such a cool person who I always think of when I am with my life-long friends. She does a lot of videos on beauty, but also incorporates her family and friends quite often, which is really refreshing. <br>Lily's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lilypebbles.co.uk/">http://www.lilypebbles.co.uk/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK-4JyAcQYBasFAe367on7w">RachhLoves</a><br>Rachel is definitely someone i'd want to be friends with. Not only does she describe her skin type as being almost identical to mine (so I follow her recommendations quite closely), but she's hilarious. Everything I want in a friend. Feel my pains, tell me what works, and make me laugh. :) </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1-szPBG7Oh4icM1FcQakQg">Fleur DeForce</a><br>Fleur is a great gal to trust for makeup tips and tricks. She gives her thoughts on all kinds of different products, and hits both drugstore and high end. Some of my <em>favorite</em> videos of hers are the "Top 10 Under Ten" style. She features ten of the best products in various categories (mascara, concealer, foundation, blush, you get the deal) under ten pounds. (now for those in the US and elsewhere, these items may come in over ten of your currency, but it's never too bad! She's also got the cutest family of furballs you've ever seen! (you can follow them @furdeforce on Instagram). <br>Fleur's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://fleurdeforce.blogspot.com/">http://fleurdeforce.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zSySQab9SA6Wz569WDgqw">Ingrid Nilsen</a><br>Ingrid is the girl everyone can relate to. She's funny, honest, and makes beautiful videos. She likes to get down to who people are as humans, as well as what is fun to slap on your face with makeup. I've never met someone who's into watching beauty vloggers and doesn't love Ingrid. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RX7Rb0D8xmWGWIwL8kvmQ">Amelia Liana</a><br>Amelia is downright hilarious. She's super honest, talks about products she genuinely loves and uses, and is fearless with fashion. She's got a cute pup also, Duke. Her vlogs are some of my favorite! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qk9TtGhBKCkoWz5qGJcGg">Tati</a><br>Tati tells the truth. She does these <em>wonderful</em> videos testing out and reviewing products—right on camera. Want to know if a foundation lasts on your face? Watch Tati. Want to know if a new beauty launch is worth the hype? Watch Tati. Want to get a real-life review of products you've been eyeing? WATCH TATI! Need I say more?</p>
<p>Now, since I mentioned above that blogging requires honesty, i'll get real with you here. I watch many, many more YouTubers than just those ten. So many that the full list would have you all wondering if I ever do anything else with my time. YouTube is essentially my Netflix. It was very hard to narrow down this list, but I think you'll really enjoy those ladies! </p>
<p>Do you have any favorite YouTubers?</p>
