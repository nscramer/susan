<p>Ever since I finished my reading goal from my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/30-before-25/">30 before 25</a> list, I’ve been seriously slacking in the reading department. So, I wanted to start putting together seasonal reading lists of books that I really want to set out to read that season. Now, there will likely (hopefully) be more than this, but this list is a collection of books I’ve been meaning to read.</p>
<p>(The description of each book is pulled from <a target="_blank" href="http://goodreads.com">goodreads.com</a>, the few sentences after are my own thoughts on why i’d like to read the book!)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18142414-sous-chef?from_new_nav=true&amp;ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Sous Chef</a>—<em>In this urgent and unique book, chef Michael Gibney uses twenty-four hours to animate the intricate camaraderie and culinary choreography in an upscale New York restaurant kitchen. Here readers will find all the details, in rapid-fire succession, of what it takes to deliver an exceptional plate of food—the journey to excellence by way of exhaustion.</em><br>This caught my eye months ago as a book that Nick would like, since we’re both fascinated by cooking and the food industry, and he’s really into routines. I picked it up for him and he said it was a great read, so i’ve been eying it up ever since. I’ve not made the time to read it, so i’m going to do that now!<br>(<a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line-ebook/dp/B00FIN2IRM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459865953&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sous+chef">buy here</a>)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3281277-a-most-wanted-man?from_new_nav=true&amp;ac=1&amp;from_search=true">A Most Wanted Man</a>—<em>A half-starved young Russian man in a long black overcoat is smuggled into Hamburg at dead of night. He has an improbable amount of cash secreted in a purse around his neck. He is a devout Muslim. Or is he?</em><br>I’ve heard enough about this story when the movie came out, mostly because of it’s stellar cast LINK. But, when I can, I like to read the book first if the movie is an adaptation. I think this will be an exciting read!<br>(<a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Most-Wanted-Man-John-Carre-ebook/dp/B001FA0H3E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459865898&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+most+wanted+man">buy here</a>)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571757-it-s-what-i-do?from_new_nav=true&amp;ac=1&amp;from_search=true">It’s What I Do</a>—<em>War photographer Lynsey Addario’s memoir It’s What I Do is the story of how the relentless pursuit of truth, in virtually every major theater of war in the twenty-first century, has shaped her life. What she does, with clarity, beauty, and candor, is to document, often in their most extreme moments, the complex lives of others. It’s her work, but it’s much more than that: it’s her singular calling.</em><br>The obvious draw for me here is my love of photographs. But this book seems to also have other aspects I enjoy: a memoir style story of someone following what they’ve realized is their calling to do something that makes the world better.<br>(<a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Its-What-Do-Photographers-Life-ebook/dp/B00L9B7CSM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459865917&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=it%27s+what+i+do+a+photographer%27s+life+of+love+and+war">buy here</a>)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4588.Extremely_Loud_and_Incredibly_Close?from_new_nav=true&amp;ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</a>—<em>Nine-year-old Oskar Schell is an inventor, amateur entomologist, Francophile, letter writer, pacifist, natural historian, percussionist, romantic, Great Explorer, jeweller, detective, vegan, and collector of butterflies. When his father is killed in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre, Oskar sets out to solve the mystery of a key he discovers in his father's closet.</em><br>I’ve got a head start on this one as it’s this month’s pick for a book club i’m in! I have heard so many good things about Oskar’s journey and the beautiful way it’s written. Another one I am going to wait to see the film version of until I complete the book.<br>(<a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Extremely-Loud-Incredibly-Close-Novel-ebook/dp/B003K16PXC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459865873&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=extremely+loud+and+incredibly+close">buy here</a>)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness?from_new_nav=true&amp;ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Stumbling on Happiness</a>—<em>In this brilliant, witty, and accessible book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions.</em><br>This comes on recommendation from countless people. As someone who enjoys learning about the human brain and how the science of it all plays into our personalities and emotions, I’m sure this book will live up to the hype.<br>(<a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert-ebook/dp/B000GCFW0A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459865972&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=stumbling+on+happiness">buy here</a>)</p>
<p>I think i’ll be writing more about books here, as I really love reading and want to make it more of a constant in my daily routine.</p>
<p>Do you have any book recommendations?</p>
