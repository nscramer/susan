<p>I don’t know about you, but lately I’m really getting the duo-chrome vibes. I’ve always loved opal, holographic things, and other pretty light-reflecting items. </p>
<p>When it comes to duo-chrome, it’s having a big moment in makeup. See: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandecay.com/moondust-palette-by-urban-decay/ud773.html">Urban Decay Moondust palette</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.makeupgeek.com/eye-products/eyeshadows/makeup-geek-duochrome-eyeshadows.html">Makeup Geek Duo-Chrome shadows</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/transformer-liquid-lipstick-P384955?skuId=1552355&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p384955">Kat Von D Transformer Liquid Lipstick</a>, the list goes on. </p>
<p>I’ve purchased some makeup items in the past, but haven’t really gotten comfortable wearing them in many looks. One place I have found to let my duo-chrome flag fly, however, is my nails! </p>
<p>I have an obscene amount of nail colors like this, considering the amount I actually wear, but we’ll look past that.  I have a few all-time favorites in my collection: OPI Breathe Life, Essie Nude Beach, and H&amp;M Science Fiction. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W30GZS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B001W30GZS&amp;linkId=7afe4c4cdeeffb84dd65f79249a5281b">OPI Breath Life</a> was a limited edition release many years ago, but you can still find it on Amazon! It’s the most traditionally opalescent. It’s base is a pearly white with blue and green-ish shifts. It’s <em>beautiful</em>. The perfect color for a wedding shower or heck, even the big day! This is a go-to for me on my nails since it’s subtle but still gives off a little something. The proceeds from this little guy went (and probably still go) to lung cancer research, which hits close to home for my family and makes it a little more special. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CS7POS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B001CS7POS&amp;linkId=bfa3f53b7727bbee5c76c8e73164ea9d">Essie Nude Beach</a> is similar to Breath Life in that it’s quite sheer, but it’s a baby pink with a pale blue shift and sometimes even looks a bit orange. It’s a newer find of mine, but fits right into the realm of what I love to wear on my nails on an everyday basis. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="#">H&amp;M Science Fiction.</a> This one is, quite obviously, a bit farther out of the box for me—but would ya look at it? What a beaut. I will say, when applied to the nails it pulls very green, and you lose a bit of that deep blue that you see in the bottle. Still, it’s a dream, right?</p>

<p>What are your favorite ways to wear duo-chrome? Do you have any favorite products? </p>
