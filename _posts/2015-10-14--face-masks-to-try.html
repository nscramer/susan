<p>Since I have rather sensitive, sometimes moody, stressed skin—I am careful with the products I choose to test out. This often leads me to raid the travel section or the little isle of doom that leads one up to the register at stores like Ulta and Sephora. Good skincare is expensive. While this is one area which i'll never feel bad investing in, I still shy away from throwing down the cash before I know how my skin is going to get along with a product. </p>
<p>If you're not close to an Ulta or Sephora, turning to <a target="_blank" href="http://sephora.com">sephora.com</a> is a great option. They often pull together collections of the sample size products into different "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/brand/brandStore.jsp?searchTerm=sephora%20favorites&amp;brandId=5823">Sephora Favorites</a>". They'll do these for many different types of products: fragrance, eyeliners, mascaras, lipsticks, etc. They range in price from about $25-$100, depending on how many products are included. It's a great way to try new brands, as well! <br>While the two products I'm talking about today didn't come from one of these, I wanted to bring this up since it's such a great deal! </p>
<p>Today i'm going to hit on two great face masks i've tried lately, each for a different purpose: </p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/clear-improvement-active-charcoal-mask-to-clear-pores-P297524?skuId=1375773">Origins Clear Improvements </a>mask is a charcoal mask, for purifying the skin. The goal of this mask is to draw out all of the impurities in the pores. Since it is a charcoal mask, you apply a layer all over the face and then once it's dried, you can take it off. I find this nice since it's usually a rather short amount of time—ten, maybe 20 mins. I do love a good pamper, but I often find that I don't really get around to it until about 10:00 at night and by that time, i'm just trying to get to bed ASAP. The mask really is wonderful. It's one of those tricky ones that <em>can</em> make you break out a bit after using it, but this is just because it's pulled all impurities to the surface, so they can get out! It's about a deep clear-out, so this can happen with these types of products. You can't beat the clean feeling after using this mask! </p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/glycol-lactic-radiance-renewal-mask-P203616?skuId=1064187">REN Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask</a> is a good one to follow a few days to a week after that Origins mask. This mask is, as the name would suggest, aimed at brightening the complexion. There's a few natural acids in the mask to exfoliate, brighten and plump up the skin. It's helped to break down discoloration or hyper pigmentation, and really make my skin look healthy! This is another quick mask—ten minutes! <em>Win</em>.</p>
<p>There you have it! Two masks i'd recommend trying; and a little bit about how I like to try out new products. </p>
<p>Have you tried any skincare products recently that are worth checking out?</p>
