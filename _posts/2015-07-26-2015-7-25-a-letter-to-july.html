<p>Dear July, </p>
<p>You’ve always been a mystical month for me. You’re the month I was born in, 24 years ago. You’re usually hot, muggy, and rainy—but always beautiful. You bring green leaves and blooming flowers. You bring amazing time spent with friends and family. You bring love. </p>
<p>This year, July, you’ve been pretty stellar to me. You reminded me that I am surrounded by compassion and companionship. You brought me travel, and a break from reality that I so desperately needed. On the heels of your pal June, I was at the end of my rope. Stressed about being constantly on the go in the upcoming weeks, stressed about money, stressed about work. I’ve been on the edge of making some big changes for a while now and July, I thought for certain you’d see them. Instead, you’ve instilled some new perspectives in me. I’m choosing to step outside the stress, clear my head of unnecessary noise, and concentrate on what’s in my heart. While your successor, August, could very well go through some winds and turns with me, I will be comforted that you’ve given me the space to relax in preparation for what’s to come. I know now that it’s okay to feel like the noise around is holding you back, but it’s not okay to let that control you. </p>
<p>Thank you, July, for letting me bask in your sunny rays, sweat through your hottest days, and keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. </p>
<p>-Susan  </p>
