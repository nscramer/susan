<p>Happy New Year!<br>December has come and gone, and time got away from me while planning to write this post, so it’s a bit late. However, I really found some products I fell in love with in the month of December, and I wanted to share that with all of you!<br>Without further adieu:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10421019">Lorac Pro 2 palette</a><br>A recent *treat yo-self* purchase of mine. The Lorac Pro shadows are just some of the best on the market hands down, and many of you probably already know this. I love the cool tone of this palette. It’s got a wonderful selection of mattes and shimmers, light neutral shades and some bold ones thrown in for a bit of fun. I’ve worn shadows from this throughout the entire month!</p>

It’s meant to be a contour brush, but I have been loving it for either setting the under-eyes with powder, or for applying a powder highlight perfectly! It’s narrow, tapered shape let’s you get a precise application for your face powder needs.</p>

These aren’t new, but they’ve cycled back around to the a-team in my everyday makeup stash. I love love love the voluminous formula for top lashes. Hands down I get the most compliments when I wear this mascara. There’s zero clumps, gobs of volume, and they still look fluttery and soft. As for the telescopic formula- it’s pretty much the only one I want to use on my lower lashes. The wand is so thin and precise it’s perfect for those small hairs. Not to mention that both of these are some of the blackest mascara’s you’ll find.</p>

The complete bomb. It’s hands down my favorite type of tea to drink, and what’s not to love when it’s in this beautiful tin!</p>
