<p>It seems like most drugstore beauty brands are beginning to bring out contour palettes, which is long awaited by those of us who don't want to commit to those expensive palettes that have 3 colors you'll never touch... </p>
<p>The first one I could get my hands on was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13501035#">L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Contour</a>.  It's an addition to their Infallible line which is home to many of my most loved products from the brand. I was also most excited about this one in particular because the contour shade is actually a cool-toned, ashy brown (as a contour should be), and the Light shade is actually light enough for fair skinned peeps like myself. </p>
<p>Now, ignoring that weird looking brush that comes with it, I pretty much love this little duo. The contour shade, apart from being a great color, isn't super pigmented. This might frustrate those who like a sharp, very defined cheek, but I think it's great. It's definitely buildable, so you can work it up to be quite dramatic. But, since it starts out on the subtle side, it's pretty hard to go overboard and makes it perfect for those just starting out in the sculpting game. </p>
<p>The highlight shade is a very pretty pale gold shimmer color that's also pretty subtle, which I think is perfect for the colder months where you're not too keen on being a disco ball. That being said, when going out a few nights ago I layered this on top of my Becca Shimmering Skin Perfecter in Moonstone (the liquid version) and it was seriously glowy &amp; gorgeous. I've also mixed this with a few of my matte blushes as a topper to give a little something extra, and i'm really enjoying it. </p>
<p>Overall, L'Oreal did really well with this one. I've yet to try the Maybeline competitor (the contour looks a bit orangey and warm so i'm a tad bit nervous), but I think the Infallible Pro-Contour will be the standout for me. </p>
