<p>There's so many ideas swirling around in folk's heads about how things are <em>supposed</em> to be. But really, who decided that's how things are supposed to be? I've entered a point in life where many people I come in contact with feel the need to share advice with me on this stage. While most of it is welcomed, because in fact I have not been here before, still some of it leaves me feeling icky. </p>
<p>At first, I was pretty offended. <em>How nice of them to think I care about the same things as them! How wonderful for people to think I needed their ill-informed thoughts on my life! Please, people, let me know more how you think I should handle the many decisions to make for the event of joining my life with another person! </em></p>
<p>In case you haven't guessed, i'm recently engaged. Which is <strong>the best</strong>. I can't explain the joy i've been feeling since the moment I realized what was happening. (because when I first walked into the proposal setting, I couldn't believe it was really real.) For the last 3.5 years i've shared life with a kind and encouraging partner. Seriously, he's my champion. Each day I am amazed at the level of support and love he gives me. Keep it up, Nicolas. :) <br>So, he planned the most amazing proposal and ring that completely fit who we are. I honestly did not get that life with another person this way would feel so natural, but it does. While I understand how this might not matter to some—<em>and that's okay with me—</em>this is the coolest thing i've ever experienced in my personal life. It just is. </p>

<p>So, back to this whole imposing advice thing. <br>After I spent some time feeling sorry for myself that I had to listen to all of this, I came to a realization: <em>I do some form of this, too! </em> We all do, guys. It's human. We draw on our own experiences to share with others, thinking we're helping them in some similar situation. And hey—sometimes we are truly helping. The point is, no one has wisdom for things they've never experienced. If they are sharing such wisdom, you have permission to smile and excuse yourself as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Moral of the story here—i've had my share of venting moments to my fiance lately. But if anything, it's made me more aware of what "advice" I choose to share. I'm trying to change up the delivery, and keep anecdotes of my own experiences to a minimum. We'll call it a test.</p>
<p>Another learning I've had is more of a reminder. A reminder that I know who I am, and I know my own taste. Nick and I have been getting relationship and life advice since the moment we moved in together at 6 months of dating. I think it's important that we all do two things: <br>First, let's be confident in who we are! Let's love ourselves. Let's stand strong in our preferences. <br>Second, let's be a bit more welcoming of our differences. Not everyone wants to do the same things that we do, or likes the same things we do, or even cares about the same things we do. I know what you're thinking, this all boils down to "live and let live", and maybe it does! </p>
<p>I'm going to challenge myself to do this, and do it better. I'm going to live as me, without apologies (except when i'm grumpy and need caffeine, no one asks for that), and try not to impose that on others. In tandem, i'll be trying to accept people more. I consider myself a pretty accepting person—but sometimes I just can't hide that J from my meyers-briggs. They key here will be small, everyday things. #NoMoreJudgement</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! </p>
