<p>When it comes to nail polish, i've been known in the past to be a bit of a hoarder. I would buy a new color every time I was in the store, I built up quite the collection. Brights, neutrals, darks—I had them all.</p>
<p>I recently did a nail polish clear out, where I gifted a <em>ton</em> of colors. I had to get very real with myself about how much I would actually wear something. In doing this, I found that I was only left with neutrals, dark berry shades, and reds. Since it's getting warmer, i'm definitely gravitating towards the neutrals. I have a lot of nudes, browns, and pastels. Out of these i've had one color on my nails for about 2 months straight. When it chips, I take it off and promptly reapply.</p>
<p>Alright, alright, i'll tell you what it is: <strong>Revlon Colorstay Gel Envy</strong> in the shade <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Revlon-Colorstay-Gel-Envy-Longwear/dp/B00LUCY6ZW?sa-no-redirect=1">Checkmate</a>.</p>
<p>It's a <em>gorgeous</em> pale nudey-beige. The perfect nude, I'd venture to say. I'm a pale girl, and it doesn't wash out or blend in with my skin (which is a plus, shout out to my fellow pale gals). </p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1431568396085_68633">The formula looks opaque with just two coats, and it lasts really well without chipping. I've been using it with a <a data-cke-saved-href="http://smile.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Fast-Nail-Ounce/dp/B00150LT40/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430940512&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seche+vite+-+dry+fast+top+coat" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Fast-Nail-Ounce/dp/B00150LT40/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430940512&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seche+vite+-+dry+fast+top+coat">Seche-Vite</a> top coat, and I'm pretty much addicted.<br></p>
<p>What's your favorite nail color for spring?</p>
