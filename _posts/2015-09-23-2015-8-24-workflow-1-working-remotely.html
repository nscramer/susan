<p>One of the cool parts of my job is that we can really work from wherever we want. Home, a coffee shop, a different office, a different city. I personally think this essential for promoting a healthy company full of happy employees. It allows us to decide where we will be most productive while working, and change that up if we don't have a great vibe in a space. <br>For months, i've chosen to work out of the office at least once a week. Although recently with the addition of my puppy, Fitz, i’ve been doing this much more so I can be closer to the apartment when he needs to be taken outside!<br>Usually, these days are broken up into two 4-hour working blocks. Sounds normal, right? I find when i’m in the office I work a bit less consistently. I have lunch at different times, conversations with co-workers go down, I’m much less consistent about the solid blocks of work vs the lunch/walk breaks, etc. Not to say this is a bad thing, because it’s still the same amount of time working each day, it’s just broken up differently. <br>With these two working blocks of time, there’s a couple different ways or scenes I like to put myself in for good focus: </p>

<p>1. Working in my apartment<br>I’m lucky enough to have a big ol’ second monitor at home, and honestly it’s way nicer than the one I have on my desk at work. (although the one at the office doesn’t deter me from any good work) I also am in a space where I am comfortable and happy, which helps me when i’m working on intense projects or something that’s tedious. Sometimes, I even work from time to time on my couch (queue all the gawks from ergonomic experts). While I am the first to admit that working on the couch isn’t the best for my focus, or comfort when you have chronic back pain, it’s nice when I’m working through some “busy work”. What’s busy work? Cleaning up spreadsheets, folders of documents, converting lead information in our CRM, etc. Things that need to get done, but don’t actually require that 100% focus factor. For all other work I stick to the dining table or my desk. </p>

<p>2. Working at local coffee shops and cafe’s <br>When i’m either finding it hard to focus at home (happens when you have a pup that may be whining in his crate, or a stack of dishes in the sink you’d prefer were clean and put away…..signs of adulthood?), I hit up  a local coffee shop or cafe. Currently, we live within walking distance of one of my favorite neighborhoods in Cincinnati called Over The Rhine. There’s a host of little places with great coffee, tea, food, and wifi. I find when I need to vibe of people being around with ambient noise, these establishments are perfect.<em> (1215 Coffee lab &amp; Wine bar shown above)</em></p>
