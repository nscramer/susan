<p>Vacation is so close, guys! This Saturday we'll be jetting off to Portugal. Naturally, I had to get together a reading list for the trip, and I thought it would be fun to share it with you! </p>
<p>There is one teensy downside to the trip, and that's the <em>long</em> layovers we'll have on the journey. Since we'll have some serious time to kill in the airports both on the way there and on the way back, my list is a bit longer than what i'd normally select for a trip like this. Eight books is quite ambitious, no doubt. But, with a few of these being audio books, I think i'll actually make quite the dent in this selection! </p>

When an Irish priest from Brooklyn offers to sponsor Eilis in America -- to live and work in a Brooklyn neighborhood "just like Ireland" -- she decides she must go, leaving her fragile mother and her charismatic sister behind."</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>I have heard so many things about this! I have yet to see the film as I was waiting to read the book. Can't wait to see what all the fuss is about! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501139886/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1501139886&amp;linkId=90f8b5bbefbf78ba6599175e321c116e"><strong>The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>The Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and star of Inside Amy Schumer and the acclaimed film Trainwreck has taken the entertainment world by storm with her winning blend of smart, satirical humor. Now, Amy Schumer has written a refreshingly candid and uproariously funny collection of (extremely) personal and observational essays." </p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>Do I even need to explain this one? Amy. Schumer. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544705181/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0544705181&amp;linkId=10a567bbf9eef34c6ca5f3f0e4713e43"><strong>How to Start a Fire:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>From a bestselling writer, a story of unexpected friendship-three women thrown together in college who grow to adulthood united and divided by secrets, lies, and a single night that shaped all of them"</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>Doesn't that just sound intriguing? I love a good story that has some scandal, and I think this read will deliver that! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1442408936/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1442408936&amp;linkId=c4581e0ff25bc5e6f38081e965d1a172"><strong>Aristotle and Dante Discover The Secrets of the Universe:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When the two meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special friendship—the kind that changes lives and lasts a lifetime."</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em> I'm always on the hunt for a good YA novel, and this sounded like an interesting and fun take on an unusual pair becoming great friends. I also heard the writing was beautiful so I had to add it to the list!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804141266/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0804141266&amp;linkId=5aa8ceee01380445b1a5a80d0df24399"><strong>Vinegar Girl:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>Kate Battista feels stuck. How did she end up running house and home for her eccentric scientist father and uppity, pretty younger sister Bunny? Plus, she’s always in trouble at work – her pre-school charges adore her, but their parents don’t always appreciate her unusual opinions and forthright manner.  "</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>I'm pretty excited by all of these classic retellings that are coming about. I love to see how the same themes are applied to modern day life. Most of the time, it makes me appreciate the original even more!  </p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062335987/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0062335987&amp;linkId=fb57247b4217f169e16f58b2aadac314">How to Build a Girl</a>: </strong><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>What do you do in your teenage years when you realize what your parents taught you wasn’t enough? You must go out and find books and poetry and pop songs and bad heroes—and build yourself."</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>This book has caught a ton of attention since it came out, and I've had my eye on it for a while. I'm eager to see how it turns out! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533571/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0374533571&amp;linkId=6706ea61d7593b1684fb3b57641af232"><strong>Silver Linings Playbook:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>Meet Pat. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure a happy ending for him -- the return of his estranged wife Nikki."</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>So I haven't read this or seen the movie. I know, I know. It's a beloved story. That's why I'm making a point to read it while away! I think i'll really enjoy this, although I have a feeling it's going to pull on those ole heart strings. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060589469/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0060589469&amp;linkId=70476196da9eaf5a3d342aee900f784c"><strong>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:</strong></a><br><em>What goodreads says: "</em>One of the most important &amp; influential books written in the past half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's Zen &amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a powerfully moving &amp; penetrating examination of how we live, a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation, an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father &amp; his young son."</p>
<p><em>Why I want to read it: </em>Nick has been suggesting this book to me basically since the day we met. In an effort to prove I listen to him, I'll be getting into this one! (I also am sure I will like it, so it's not <em>all</em> about Nick :) )</p>
<p>I am planning to do a wrap up style post on this list after the vacation so you can know how much I got through and what my final thoughts on the books are! </p>
