<p>I've made many trips to Indy, but never really spent time just walking the city. When Nick and I went out for a concert recently, we spent an entire day exploring, mostly in the neighborhood called Broad Ripple. I've snapped some pics of my favorite spots we visited! </p>

<p>We had breakfast at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.milktoothindy.com/">Milktooth</a>, which is in a neighborhood called Fletcher Place. It's a really cool diner with a very tasty menu! I had the strawberry rhubarb pancake and nick had the steak and eggs. We sat at the bar right in front of the cooks—we both love to see how kitchens operate and watch people who are craftsmen when it comes to cooking! The food was <em>divine</em>. They also have a pretty enticing pastry selection which I managed to (just barely) steer clear of. Tons of character here and great food, what more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Next we hit up one of the coolest stores I've ever been in. I'm serious. If you're in Indianapolis, like reading and beautiful photos, you need to go to <a target="_blank" href="http://printtext.co/">PRINTtEXT</a>. It's a periodicals shop where you'll find the most intriguing and enticing magazines. We're not talking what you pick up while waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store—these are high production quality, beautifully crafted magazines that cover a myriad of topics. They are usually on the pricey side, but the value is high to match the cost. You'll find in depth interviews and unique photos taken by renowned photographers covering any niche you can think of. I am really drawn to travel magazines, so I picked up a copy of the eleventh issue of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boat-mag.com/">Boat</a> magazine, which is entirely about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boat-mag.com/issues/havana/">Havana, Cuba</a>. </p>

<p>While exploring the rest of Broad Ripple, we stopped into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bricsindy.com/#home">brics</a> for some delicious ice cream, caught this gorgeous wall of ivy at <a target="_blank" href="http://petitechoubistro.com/">Petite Chou</a> out of the corner of our eyes, and Nick had to peel me away from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Alley-Girls-528810873846771/">Alley Girls</a>, a fun used furniture and decor shop which had tons of character pieces. We stopped into <a target="_blank" href="http://patachouinc.com/concepts/#public-greens">Public Greens</a> for some lunch,  which is unique in that they grow most of their ingredients right outside of the restaurant! I had a Thai Barely salad which was the perfect light lunch for a day of exploring.</p>
<p>All of these spots are must-visits the next time you're in Indianapolis! </p>
