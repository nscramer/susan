<p>It’s been about 2 months since I posted about my mantra for the year of 2016.<br>In case you missed this post where I introduced the idea, I adopted the phrase “Mindfulness is not bullshit” as my mantra for this year. I’d like to be more mindful of my mind, body, and overall health. I’ve been working so far on listening to my body much more than I ever used to. I’m eating better due planning my meals during the week, and really getting a sense for when certain foods make me feel good and energized vs. sluggish and tired.<br><br>As far as being more mindful of my brain and it’s workings, that’s still a work in progress. I’ve always been a bit of a stressed out gal, so it’s hard for me to find a good approach to this aspect. I still work on quick meditations now and then, but i’ve not found sitting for a long period of time very successful just yet. To be honest and risk sounding like a child, sitting still isn’t always that relaxing to me. To top off the stubborn vibe here, it’s sometimes hard to stick it out for 30 minutes when you’re realizing you’re not all that good at letting the thoughts drift away. I’m being open and honest here because I want people to realize that while this is somewhat of “the thing” to do right now, it’s not going to come easily for everyone.<br>So, I’m still working on it.<br><br>Where do I go from here?<br>I plan to do some studying. Of those who I think are great at this. There are people in my life who I know practice this idea of mindfulness, and I plan to see what I can learn from them. I also want to focus more on why I’m doing this as opposed to just doing it because I said I would. What brought me to this conclusion other than it sounding like the right/good thing to do.<br>Back to basics, people.</p>
<p>Are you tracking any goals for the year? How are they going?</p>
