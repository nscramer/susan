<p>Champagne Pop. The infamous highlighter to top all highlighters made by BECCA in collaboration with Jaclyn hill herself, is something I honestly never thought I’d pick up. I love a good highlight, but I was concerned about how gold it was and frankly thought it wouldn’t look good against my pale skin. Because of that, I’ve not purchased or tried any of her collaborations with BECCA. Then, the Champagne Splits happened. I had been eyeing up the BECCA luminous blushes for some time, and when I saw they were doing a split of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/becca-x-jaclyn-hill-champagne-collection-P409117?skuId=1832534&amp;icid2=just_arrived_toplevel_us_skugrid:p409117">Champagne Pop highlighter and Flower Child blush</a> I didn’t think twice before ordering it.  </p>

<p>First off, <em>would ya look at it?</em> <strong>Swoon.</strong> </p>
<p>I think you can see that the packaging is to die for. Mixed metals, a big mirror, and quite big pans for a two in one product. It feels weighty in the hand, really luxe, not that I expected anything less! </p>

<p>To get on to the products themselves—there has been a lot of controversy around these guys in the beauty world. After an incident regarding another recent collaboration between Jaclyn and BECCA, people  seemed to have their magnifying glasses out ready to scrutinize their next move. I’ve read the ingredients lists, there are some differences between what’s in these split pans and the full size versions of each product. Why is that? BECCA says they’re in the process of reformulating some of their products to be better their customers. Are they allowed to do that? Absolutely. I’m of the opinion that if you don’t like the ingredients in a certain product, don’t buy it! </p>

<p>I, for one, love the blush. Flower Child is a perfect mid-toned pink shade with a slight warm shimmer running through. What people say is true, these babies are pigmented. A little goes a long way and you’ll need to be sure to tab off any excess before hitting your cheeks. But, once on and blended out, I’m a huge fan. It’s been a fast favorite of mine. </p>
<p>Champagne Pop, while flipping gorgeous in the pan, might be a bit too warm toned for my skin, as I suspected. I’ve worn it a few times, and really loved the way it looked on the cheeks, but I’m still experimenting. I’m not sold on the texture, I think my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/light-source-illuminating-highlighter?productId=xlsImpprod13811033#">Lorac Illuminating Highlighter</a> in Daylight is a bit softer and more densely pigmented, but it’s by no means scratchy. I have found that I <em>love</em> using it as an inner corner highlight on the eyes! </p>

<p>All in all, I have no doubt I’ll get use out of it. It’s a great way to get an intro into two different BECCA offerings at once, especially since I can’t say I’ve ever seen the pan of any of my blushes or highlighters. I see this as a very easy to choose cheek duo to pick up if you’re looking to consolidate for everyday or for traveling! </p>
<p>Have you tried these or any other BECCA cheek products? </p>
