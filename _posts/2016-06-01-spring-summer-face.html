<p>I don’t know about you, but I <em>love</em> a good smoky eye and a bold lip. I’m totally willing to spend time blending away trying to replicate those beautiful looks ladies like Sharon and Jacklyn create. However, when the temps rise in the midwest, the humidity skyrockets as well and piling on the products is basically just asking to look like a panda by noon. Luckily, I’ve found some go-to (some old, some new) products for the hotter months that keep my look light and bright to match the sunny weather.  </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod6200727">Mario Badescu Facial Spray</a>- this isn’t a new product on the market, but it’s new to me. After hearing <em>everyone</em> rave about this spray, I figured it wouldn’t hurt me to try it out. First off, the price tag is amazing. Secondly, the scent is amazing. And thirdly, the refreshing feeling it gives is—you guessed it—amazing. I tend to use this as the last step in my skincare routine, right before going to sleep. I also use it right after applying my makeup, and throughout the day when I need a bit of a refresher. It’s perfect for those days where you’re overwhelmed with the heat and need a bit of a cool down.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10791919">Clinique Even Better Foundation SPF 15</a>- I keep coming back to this darling. I’ve used it for years—this is probably my 4th or 5th bottle of the stuff. I love Clinique bases, they were some of my first higher end base products ever purchased! (I used to layer up the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10791897">Superpowder</a> when I got hit with acne in my teens..it wasn't pretty but we've all moved on) This offering from the brand packs a decent punch in the coverage department, but retains a dewy, skin-like finish. I do like to use a pore filler with this and powder in my oily areas, but all in all it’s a great option, and the SPF makes it good for the sunnier days!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4190143#">Bare Minerals Marvelous Moxie Lipgloss in Trailblazer-</a> This was gifted to me by lovely friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sarahbalarah/">Sarah</a>. Just in the nick of time as I had it on my wish list to buy this spring! It’s a delightful peachy-nude gloss that really compliments lighter makeup looks. It’s the first Marvelous Moxie gloss I’ve tried, and I really like this formula. Not sticky at all and has a nice minty scent with a cool feeling on the lips. I think i’ll grab some more of these! </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13811033#">Lorac Light Source Illuminating Highlighter in Daylight-</a> This baby is new. Ohhh man, I gravitated right toward this. There are a few shades in this range of highlighters from Lorac, but there was no question that the shade Daylight was the one for me. It’s a pale champagne gold that is all of the glow you could ever want without any of the glitter. It’s smooth and creamy, and I’ve basically been dipping my entire face in it on a regular basis. I’m loving applying it with the Real Techniques Setting brush; going for the tops of the cheek bones, the nose, cupids bow, under the brow, and even all over the lid on most days. (wasn’t kidding—dipping my face in it.) I’m pretty obsessed with how this looks, and I think it’ll be a staple in my routine for a long time.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10791941#">Clinique Cheek Pop in Melon Pop—</a>I picked up this little number a few months back as I don’t have any other blushes in a similar color. I tend to lean towards the mauves and pale pinks. I was debating between this shade and the shade Nude Pop (much closer to shades I usually go for), but i’m so glad I went for Melon Pop! It looks a bit daunting in the pan, but it’s not the most pigmented, which I find good for a blush. It gives the most beautiful wash of bright, peachy color to the face, and comes with an adorable little daisy embossed on it. What more could you ask for?</p>
