<p>Is anyone else becoming quickly obsessed with greenery in their home? I know, obviously, house plants have been a thing for a very long time. I’ve never been good at keeping them alive to be honest. I have a few succulents that are going strong and i’m quite proud of that!<br>I’ve always liked having fresh flowers, but we all know how pricy that can get. Lately, though, i’ve been becoming much more interested in flowers, flower arrangements, and greenery. I’m seeing a trip to the local nursery in my future…<br>We have a move coming up, which is quite exciting for many reasons (hello, redecorating!). But one of the things i’m most excited about is many more spaces to keep plants.<br>First of all, I am a huge supporter of having a mixture of both real and faux plants. Ikea has some really nice faux greens that I really like scattering around my home. There’s just so much to be said about having the greenery be your pop of color! Since I keep a mostly monochromatic home, the plants can really stand out and bring life to the room.</p>
<p>Something we’re really excited to do in the new home is try out a version of a living wall. We won’t do a super busy or filled wall, since our rooms aren’t that big and we don’t want to overwhelm a space, but we’re definitely going to do something similar. I really like this idea:</p>

<p>I also really enjoy smaller installments, like this:<br> </p>

<p>I’m planning on increasing my single-potted plant collection, but also looking into making a terrarium! I think these are such a fun way to do something different and incorporate plants. There are so many different takes on how to make these so you can try out what you find the most interesting. <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bhg.com/gardening/houseplants/care/make-a-terrarium/?socsrc=bhgpin072613BuildATerrarium">This tutorial really caught my eye. </a></em>totally doable. </p>

<p>How do you like to incorporate greenery into your space?</p>
