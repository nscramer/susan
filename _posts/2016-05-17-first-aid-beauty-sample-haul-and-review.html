<p>I've been trying out new skincare products here and there lately looking for a great set of simple, straightforward products that take care of my sensitive, dehydrated skin. I've heard so many great things about First Aid Beauty, but never tried them before, so I decided to try multiple options! One thing I love about the brand is the range of sample and travel size products they offer. I'm big on testing smaller sizes of products instead of going whole hog right away and buying the full size bottles. I feel like I don't waste as much, because who really knows what happens to the products you return? (but really, if you do know, please share!) </p>
<p>Anywho, there were some winners and some runner ups; here's the list!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/skin-rescue-deep-cleanser-with-red-clay-P384539?skuId=1567205&amp;icid2=search_search_p384539_image">Skin Rescue Deep Cleanser with Red Clay</a>- Love this! it's very simple and the scent is minimal, but it really does give a deep clean! I love this for using in the evening as my second cleanse to really get the gunk of the day off my face. Will be purchasing the full size! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/face-cleanser-P248404?skuId=1217710&amp;icid2=search_search_p248404_image">Face Cleanser</a>- this is okay as your basic cleanser. It didn't break me out, so that's a plus, but I didn't really love it for removing makeup and while it's not fragranced, the scent kind of put me off. However, if you're looking for a simple cleanser to do the job, I think this would work well! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/facial-radiance-pads-P278317?skuId=1309608&amp;icid2=search_search_p278317_image">Facial Radiance Pads</a>- These are amazing! I've been experiencing a lot of texture in certain areas of my face lately and kind of stumped as to what to do about it. I'd never really gotten into chemical exfoliants before, but I'm really enjoying these! I've been using them 2-3 times weekly as my first step in the mornings, in place of my normal toner. I'm definitely noticing smoother, brighter skin! Purchasing the full size of these as soon as I run out. Another note about this product—the sample size packaging is amazing. It's perfect for travel! I love that they went with a resealable packet as opposed to the foil packets you open once then have to root around for a ziploc baggy to put the remaining ones in so they don't dry out. </p>

I've been struggling for a simple cream to use at night that isn't aimed at intense moisturizing or intense anything. My skin is very sensitive, and does produce a decent amount of oil overnight, so a lighter night cream works better for me. This fits the bill! It's lightweight, has no scent, and does the job! I got ballsy and ordered the full size straight away with this, so i'm set! I may start using this in the mornings as well, if I ever fall out of love with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/rosy-outlook">Fresh Rose Hydrating Gel Cream</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have any favorites from First Aid Beauty?</p>
