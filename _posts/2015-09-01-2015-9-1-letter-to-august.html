<p><em>Dear August, </em></p>
<p><em>Oh, my my. Well August, it’s time to say goodbye. You were hot and semi-miserable. However, Fitzgerald came home, and that has been a blessing. He’s a handful and a ball of love. With you August, my patience and stress has been pushed to it’s limits. I love my pup immensely, but it was definitely a big adjustment. Now, August, as you ride off into the distance, my little family has found a balance that works for us. We’re getting well into the groove of having a four-legged dog-child, and things are looking up. He’s getting so big! I cannot wait to watch him continue to grow and learn. I must say, August, I’m ready for your dear friend September. I’m so ready for the cooler temperatures. The sweaters, the days in the park, and long walks through our city. While like July, you didn’t see the changes I was thinking you may, I’m content with that. It’s all a journey, and August you were a great step along the way. </em></p>
