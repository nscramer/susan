<p>For a long time, I had quite the love affair with liquid eyeliner. I was the cat-eye queen. I wore one everyday without fail and didn't touch many other products. I still hold true to my belief that winging out some black eyeliner is the easiest way to look fancy for an occasion, while it's also the easiest way to look edgy for very different occasions. </p>
<p>This summer I loosened my grip on the old dependable look and started to fall in love with eyeshadow. While I am still exploring that relationship and loving it, I recently had a root around my eyeliner bin and found that I have accumulated many, many tubes of the stuff. So of course, I played around with all of the different formulas and quickly remembered which ones were my favorites. As I've tried <em>so</em> many, I thought I'd pass my knowledge on to those who might be in search of the perfect black liquid eyeliner. </p>
<p><strong>Let's start with the ones I love, stand by, and will repurchase a million times over: </strong><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/infallible-super-slim-liquid-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod4960073"><em>L'Oreal The Super Slim:</em></a> I kind of hate this one when I first bought it. It's a felt tip pen that is a bit dryer than what i've been used to working with. It sat in the drawer for a few weeks before I pulled it out again to give it another whirl, and it had really grown on me!. The nice thing about this, and the reason it is a love of mine, is how matte it is. I like to use it to create a softer flick for a more smokey look. <br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/line-stiletto-ultimate-precision-liquid-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod2830021&amp;_requestid=4774668"><em>Maybeline Line Stiletto:</em></a> Do I even need to explain this one? It's been around for many moons, and was my very first liquid eyeliner. For that, it holds a special place in my heart. And I still buy it!<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/tattoo-liner-P245205?skuId=1177567&amp;icid2=kvd_bestsellers_carousel_us:p245205"><em>Kat Von D Tattoo Liner:</em></a> Another product that probably needs no explanation. This baby has a brush tip, which I didn't know would make all the difference it does! I've actually received a handful of sample sizes of this as well, so I haven't had to purchase a full one in a while, but when I'm out—you can bet I will pick it up right away. This one is my go-to for long days or events. It's matte, opaque, very easy to use, and lasts <em>forever</em>. </p>
<p><strong>For the ones I don't love: </strong><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/eyeko-fat-liquid-eyeliner"><em>Eyeko Fat:</em></a> I don't really get the point of this offering. It's such a huge applicator I can't quite figure out how to get any sort of clean line out of it. Also, it's not the most opaque so it takes a couple of coats to build that up. <br><em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/colorstay-skinny-liquid-liner?productId=xlsImpprod10521131">Revlon Super Skinny:</a> </em>I had high hopes for this. However, I actually find this applicator to be too skinny! I should have known from the name, right? I prefer a bit of a thicker applicator as it just won't take as long to apply. <br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eyeliner?productId=xlsImpprod1840049"><em>Stila Stay All Day:</em></a> This one will be controversial, I know it. This is a cult favorite in the beauty community that so many people swear by. The thing that guts me about this eyeliner is that the formula is pretty much perfect. It's matte, opaque, and long lasting. However, again it's the applicator that kills me on this one! It's another felt tip, but it's very flimsy. I found that after a few uses, the very tip of it kind of balled up and wasn't holding product. You have to know that the tip is important for getting that crisp line. Once that happened, it became too much of a hassle to use this, and sadly it's just been sitting around collecting dust. <br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/ink-liner-P385908?skuId=1585819&amp;icid2=kvd_eyeenlightenment_carousel:p385908"><em>Kat Von D Ink Liner:</em></a> This formula is quite different from it's sister I mentioned before. It's rather watery and needs building up to get the right opacity. Also, it's a little more of a shiny finish which isn't my favorite. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I'll be clearing out the ones I don't like to just edit down to the ones I reach for often!</p>
<p>Do you have any favorite liquid liners? Any I should try?<br> </p>
