<p>Summer is officially upon us! Time to soak up the sun and get that tanned skin and tousled waves we all dream of (real or faux). If you're like me, you tend to take much better care of your skin when more of it is showing. <em>Sorry, Winter skin. </em>Summer is when I stock up on the all things that keep my skin silky smooth. I'm sharing with you my five favorite beauty products for summer, covering body + hair, and <strong>bonus: </strong>they're all available at the drugstore!  </p>

<p>First up, let's talk exfoliation. I have a couple tips in this department. If you have sensitive skin like me, you should definitely stick to sugar based scrubs, as opposed to salt based scrubs. Sugar is much gentler on your skin, doesn't dry you out the way salt does, but still gives you the softest results you could hope for! My hands down favorite scrub is the <a target="_blank" href="https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_14?url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&amp;field-keywords=tree+hut+sugar+scrub&amp;sprefix=tree+hut+sugar+scrub%2Cbeauty%2C150&amp;rh=n%3A3760911%2Ck%3Atree+hut+sugar+scrub">Tree Hut Shea Sugar Scrub</a>. It comes in many different scents, all of which are divine and leave you smelling great. I also think this scrub actually moisturizes my skin as it's exfoliating it. <em>Thank you, sugar scrub.</em> I've tried many different scrubs and for the price—this just can't be beat! My next exfoliation tip: get yourself a foot file. Unless you're getting regular pedicures or constantly sleeping in those lotion therapy socks, my guess is you could use some help on your heels. It's natural for them to get dry, and mine get <em>extremely</em> dry and cracked. I was recently able to try out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.target.com/p/amope-pedi-perfect-wet-dry-electronic-pedicure-foot-file-and-callus-remover-1-count/-/A-50306752">Amope Pedi Perfect</a>* foot file, and it's a dream! You can use this wet or dry, and it has two different speeds depending on how intense you need it to be. The file spins, and you just glide it along the area in question until you've reached your desired smoothness! Perfect-o. </p>
<p>Now, after you've gotten rid of all the rough or dead skin, you know you have to moisturize! I tend to stick to and old favorite, the Aveno Daily Moisturizing Lotion. It's as basic as you can get, but it does exactly what you need it to! I also love that it's unscented. Another sensitive skin plight, sometimes perfumed lotions can really irritate my skin, so for daily use I stick to non-perfumed lotions. One thing I will say, though, is although it's lacking scent, it still contains alcohol. Since alcohol dries out your skin, it's not the best. While I've never had any issues with the Aveno lotion and I will continue to use it, I am always hunting for an affordable body lotion that doesn't contain any alcohol. If you have recommendations—please share! </p>
<p>Something I can't leave out of a Summer beauty essentials conversation is SPF. I'll go ahead an be the one thousandth broken record—<em>you must wear SPF! </em>It's just a no-brainer. Now, I have a favorite, and that's the <a target="_blank" href="#">Neutrogena Beach Defense Water + Sun Protection in SPF 70</a>. I know that a few of you just got wide-eyed on that one. But hey, I'm <strong>very</strong> pale. If this girl is getting any color, it's usually not real. I use such a high SPF because in the sun, I tend to just burn. And I burn quite fast and quite badly. It's painful, lasts a long time, and then all the skin peels away and I'm back to being pasty white. Due to that, I stick with a higher SPF to protect from burns. I use this whether i'm out at the pool or just walking around outside. Getting burnt is no fun, and ending up with melanoma is also no fun. Take it from someone who used to fry herself in the tanning bed as a teenager—it's really not worth it. Protect your skin, it's the only skin you have!<br>Additional note: I also really love the smell of this SPF! Very beachy and vacation-like without only smelling like gross SPF. </p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, let's talk summer hair. If i'm being honest, I tend to rock the messy waves year round. This means I've tried many sea sprays. And I mean, <strong>many</strong>. From high end to low, I always come back to this. This being the <a target="_blank" href="https://smile.amazon.com/John-Frieda-Beach-Blonde-Waves/dp/B00P1NBL40/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1466512813&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=john+frieda+beach+blonde+sea+waves+sea+salt+spray">John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray</a>. It's under 10 dollars, and a few spritzes through the ends of your hair after curling it will give you that "just came from the surf" look you've been after. There are definitely some nice sea sprays on the high end of things, but seeing how often I go through the stuff (this is my 4th bottle of the John Frieda), I can't justify spending so much. Try this one out if you're looking for a great alternative to those pricier options! </p>
