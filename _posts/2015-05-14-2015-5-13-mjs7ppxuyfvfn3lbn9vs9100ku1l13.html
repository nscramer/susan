<p>I've been having a hell of a time with my skin lately. I'm talking, breakouts everyday—and the painful kind that take over your concentration and hurt really bad. I also naturally have very red, blotchy, uneven skin with many acne scars and hyper pigmentation. To top it all off, my skin basically eats makeup. I know, that sounds gross, but I don't know how else to describe it. It soaks right in by the end of the day and I've also been trying new products to reduce this (more on that at a later date).</p>
<p>Part of my problem is my love for products. Skincare, makeup, hair, I tend to want all of the things for all of those. Also, I'm obsessed with beauty youtubers, so I sometimes take their recommendations to mean I should <em>go buy that right now</em>. Which, is entirely in my own head, but I trust these ladies! (since most of them have similar skin types or tones to me) Anywho, I got on a bit of a binge trying out samples of different products. Both high end and drugstore; I was trying tons of cleansers, treatments, masks, moisturizers, and primers. I usually try different makeup quite often, and it doesn't cause too many problems. But, when trying new skincare—I put my poor face through the ringer. I kept thinking <em>"oh this will sort itself out in a few weeks, it's just an initial reaction"</em>, but in a few weeks I was likely on to something else new and shiny, causing more problems. I got to the point where I was truly upset on a daily basis when I would take off my makeup and see the state of my skin. I didn't feel confident to have my makeup off around my boyfriend of over a year whom I live with, which just doesn't suit me. I came to terms with it being my own doing, and if it was going to change, I had to chill out on the product testing mania. </p>
<p>So, I did some research (yes, via youtube and blogs), and found people with similar issues describing what worked for them. I settled on two main products (one of which I had used in the past) to add into the few staple items I never stopped using—and I decided to stick with them to see how they worked. Which means I went out on a limb I don't often visit: purchasing the full size product. Now, my skincare regimen looks like this: </p>

<h3>As for the two products that i've recently added:</h3>
<p>The first of the three is the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Serum. I heard about this from many people, but one gal who I think is the awesomest, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ohhaiclaire">HeyClaire</a> (seriously, she's awesome, subscribe to her channel A$AP like Rocky), gave this product a very great review. It's known to not only prevent new breakouts, but also to start breaking up and fading any scaring. (a desperate need of mine).</p>
<p>The second new item is the Liz Earle Cleanse &amp; Polish. I got a sample of this in my Birchbox about a year ago. This was before I got into cleansing balms and oils—also know as the lazy girls savior for removing makeup—so I wasn't <em>that</em> into it. I pulled it back out recently, and quickly fell in love. It works wonders at breaking down and removing makeup, and it's natural ingredients are so gentle and good for the skin. (Hint: if you're in the US you can get your hands on Liz Earle products through Birchbox, which is fabulous because hello—Points! :) ) </p>
<p>I've been rocking those routines for a few weeks and things seem to be looking up—I will keep you posted! </p>
