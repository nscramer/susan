<p>In the beginning of December, the dreaded feeling of realizing your planner is coming to an end started to come over me. I was about to finish my fourth <a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Moleskine-Weekly-Notebook-Large-Scarlet/dp/B00O80WC2M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453775639&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=moleskine+weekly+planner+large">Moleskine Weekly Planner</a>. A product which I do love very much and would recommend to anyone looking for a classy, simple way to organize their days. This time, though, I wanted to try something that offers a little more.<br>I've seen plenty of planners out there for different goals and focus areas. Most popular right now, <em>I think</em>, is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.erincondren.com/lifeplanner">Erin Condren Life Planner</a>. Now, I looked these up and down, and just wasn't sure I was into the myriad of colors going on. I prefer a minimal, clean look to planners.<br>There’s also the <a target="_blank" href="http://gettoworkbook.com/">Get To Work Book</a>, which is probably the closest thing to what I wanted, and as you can see was an inspiration for the design elements of mine. So, these two in mind, I set about my pro-con list to decide which one to purchase. I wanted to do some goal tracking on a monthly basis, and I wanted to include fun things as well.<br>When it came down to it, I couldn’t pull the trigger on either of them. I just didn’t feel 100% in on them. And, if you’re type A like me, you know what i’m talking about. A planner is something you’ll carry around every day for an entire year. Not to mention, I tend to hang on to them for a while after they’re full, like documentation of what I did the year before. I find them pretty cool to look back on occasionally.</p>
<p>Now, there’s nothing really wrong with any of the planners I mentioned above, it’s just that they were either lacking something I wanted, or had too many extras that I wouldn’t get use out of.<br>This lead me to try my hand at creating my own planning system. So, I started mocking up what I thought I wanted my days to look like in a planner. I took inspiration from many planners I’d surveyed in my search, and landed on a very simple set up of a schedule, to-do list, and a section for notes. I later ended up adding a section to take note of what was for dinner each day, as a goal I have for this year is to get more adventurous in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I printed out a few of these days to test them out in the first work week of the year, and I <em>really </em>liked them. I started thinking that I actually might just go for it and make my own—get it professionally printed and bound and everything. From there, a friend of mine sent me a link to <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2015/01/20/design-and-print-custom-planner/">this post</a></em>, where the author talks about how he used a site called <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blurb.com/">blurb.com</a></em> to make his own planner and get it printed for super cheap. This was the golden ticket! That same friend also happens to be a designer (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/GraceFDesign?ref=hdr_shop_menu">check out her Esty shop!</a>), and she offered to help me with the design of my planner. We got it set up into this order:<br>Photo pages<br>Monthly Calendars + Plans<br>Weekly Overviews<br>Daily Pages<br>Monthly Reflections</p>
<p>We messed around with the look of it and how everything flowed, but I was pretty positive about what I wanted so it didn't take long. It cost about $26 using Blurb to get it color printed and hard bound. <em>Score.</em><br>And can I say—I’m <em>obsessed</em> with how it turned out!<br>The paper quality is really top notch; there is absolutely zero bleed through from my trusty <a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Pilot-Precise-Stick-Rolling-35334/dp/B00006IEBI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453775514&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pilot+v5">Pilot Precise V5's</a> and really no ghosting either. </p>
<p>I only ordered the beginning of the year through the end of June, so if I want any changes I can make those for the second half of the year. I will likely have an update style post coming in a few months to let you know how i'm liking it and what I would change! </p>
<p>What planning system do you swear by? </p>
