<p>I grew up with a dog in my family, and I have loved them ever since we first brought her home. Her name was Mia, she was a mix between and Alaskan Malamute and a Spitz. She was a wonderful pup and the best companion! Late last year, we said goodbye to my sweet girl as she was 15 years old and suffering from a few different medical issues. </p>
<p>At that point, I knew right away that I wanted a dog of my own. Since Mia was my family's dog, she stayed with my Dad when my brother and I moved out and I instantly missed having a canine around. When I first moved out, one of my roommates was allergic to dogs, so I put my puppy plans on hold. (Admittedly, a good thing for me at the time because I was <em>definitely</em> not ready!) </p>
<p>After moving in with Nick this past January, I was able to wear him down on getting a dog. He loves dogs, also, but wasn't sure about getting one since there's no doubt that it definitely changes your lifestyle. We talked about when to get one, what breed we wanted, if we wanted a more grown dog or a puppy, and where we wanted to go looking for one. We landed on a puppy golden retriever. In our city, when looking for a puppy that's a specific breed, unfortunately your only real choice is a breeder. I am 100% for adopting dogs from shelters that are in need of good homes, and can honestly say I plan to do so in the future. </p>
<p>I did a lot of research on breeders in the area, I was adamant about choosing the right one for us. I wanted to make sure they did everything humanely, the pups were loved by the breeder in their first 8 weeks, and the dogs who were being bred were also treated well. I found a few breeders that are not too far from where we live, and started emailing away. Around here, as with many places I would assume, it's <em>very</em> normal to be put onto a wait list. For some breeds, these waitlists can be up to a year long! Knowing this, I put myself on a few, and really thought through my notes to these people so they knew Nick and I genuinely wanted a companion we could love and give a great home to. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be contacted rather quickly by one breeder to let me know that in 2 months time, two litters of pups would be born, and there were still spots available on the list for them. I was elated! We mulled it over for a day or two, to make sure the timing would work out, then decided to go for it! </p>
<p>Our little ball of fur was born at the beginning of May, and we are going to meet the pups for the first time this week! More information on our pup, our story of getting him, and many pictures to come! </p>
