<p>This past weekend was Nick + I's anniversary, and he surprised me with a weekend trip to Nashville! It's a city I've been to a few times when I was younger, but this time we explored the parts of the city which are far from the famous honky-tonks on Broadway. </p>
<p>We stayed at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels/index.html">Aloft hotel</a>; the place had a very cool vibe with live music in the bar. (not uncommon for this town) When walking around we saw a lot of both Vanderbilt and Belmont's campuses, which are of course beautiful! Near Vanderbilt in Hilsboro Village, we gawked over the line at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thepancakepantry.com/">Pancake Pantry</a>, ended up getting an awesome breakfast at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bongojava.com/fido-cafe/about/">Fido</a> instead, and had a quick coffee/tea break at <a target="_blank" href="http://revelatorcoffee.com/">Revelator</a> (<em>highly</em> recommend this place!). </p>
<p>There's another neighborhood not far from Hilsboro called 12 South that's full of beautiful shops, taprooms, and eateries. There's such a great vibe to this neighborhood, and the weather was perfect so everyone was out and about. </p>
<p>An interesting thing about this area is that many of the shops and restaurants seem to be in old auto service stations, which gives a really open vibe with a feeling of history, like the place has been lived in and seen some things. We loved it. A few notable shops are <a target="_blank" href="https://imogeneandwillie.com/">Imogene + Willie</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/smorelove615/">S'more Love Bakery</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://ameliasflowertruck.com/">Amelia's Flower Truck</a>. </p>
