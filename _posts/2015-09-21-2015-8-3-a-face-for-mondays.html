<p>It's a quick one today- wanted to share my really simple makeup routine that's ending up being my beginning of the week, back to work go-to look. </p>
<p>I start with the base of all bases (that never seems to get enough love in the beauty world), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/even-better-makeup-spf-15-P234967?skuId=1332295">Clinique's Even Better foundation</a>. It's been around for years, and I've been using it this whole time. Sometimes it gets buried in the bottom of the drawer, but when I want a flawless, skin-like, demi-matte finish, I always come back to this one.  </p>
<p>From there I'll sweep a little <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/hoola-matte-bronzer-P290636?keyword=BENEFIT%20COSMETICS%20Hoola%20Matte%20Bronzer%20P290636&amp;skuId=513234&amp;_requestid=30568">Benefit Hoola</a> basically all over my face to warm it up, followed by tapping some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/shimmering-skin-perfector-spf-25-P375987?skuId=1462654">Becca Shimmering Skin Perfecter in the shade Moonstone</a> over my cheek bones. </p>
<p>With the eyes I've been grabbing the <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/bobbi-brown-long-wear-cream-shadow-stick/3442219?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=344">Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Shadow Stick in the shade Sunlight Gold</a>, going all over the lid and heavy on the inner corners to highlight. Then it's a few coats of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4950087">Maybeline The Rocke</a>t mascara to really give the lashes an oomph. </p>
<p>I finish off the look with one of my favorite pinky nude shades, the revlon lip butter in berry smoothie, and I'm out the door!  </p>
<p>What's your go-to simple look for a Monday?  </p>
