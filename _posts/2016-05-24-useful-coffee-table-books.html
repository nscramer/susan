<p>Let's face it, coffee table books are <em>addicting</em>. They look pretty, they're a great addition to the style of your home, and they can really show off the personality and interests of whoever lives in the space. But, do you ever find yourself shelling out the cash on these books and then once you get them home you don't actually <em>read </em>them? C'mon, I know I'm not the only one guilty of this. Sometimes we forget that these books have amazing stories, information, and photos residing within them. There are two books in my collection that stand out to me, as these are ones whose covers i'm in love with, but I also love what's inside. </p>

<p>The first one is a cookbook, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/home-books-cookbooks/34182105.jsp"><em>Sunday Suppers</em></a>. This was a gift I received last Christmas, and was quite fitting as I have a goal this year to try out one new recipe each week. The style of this one is basically me, in a book. I love the covers, the pages, and the photography. Some of the recipes are a little on the advanced side, but I've still made use of a few! You may or may not know my addiction to Mexican food...okay so it's really just tacos and guac. This book has a whole section devoted to the Taqueria—dreams come true. The book is separated out by time of day and/or an event such as a holiday, so you can do breakfast, lunch, and dinner all from the same cookbook! </p>

<p>The next, hits my heart pretty hard. Another perfectly fitting gift for me. I've always had a thing for flowers, but I was recently inspired to learn more about them. The women in my family have always known seemingly all there is to know about plants and flowers. My grandmother and mom can name just about any plant they see. I always took this for granted until I wanted to get plants for my new home. I, of course, called on my mom to help me pick, but I wanted to learn for myself as well! So, this book, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Flower-Workshop-Arranging-Branches-Materials/dp/1607747650/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464012862&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+flower+workshop">The Flower Workshop</a></em>, along with some others is helping me do that! It's broken up by colors, type of flower, or specific elements of arrangements. It even has recipes for each featured arrangement, so you could take it to your local nursery and get exactly what's needed to recreate them! The author of this book, <a target="_blank" href="http://ariellaflowers.com/about/">Ariella Chezar</a>, is very talented in the floral industry, she actually holds these Flower Workshops (the inspiration for the book) in person! </p>
