<p>Ahhh, Fall, my old friend. So close, yet so far away. To say I am excited would be the biggest understatement you've heard all year. It's (clearly) my favorite season, could you tell?<br>Although summer makeup has really had it's moment in my routines this year, I'm giddy just thinking about dark, vampy lips and smokey eye looks. To all the berry tones and browns: get on my face! Blush has always been one of my favorite makeup steps, and Fall is when I break out all of my mauve-y rose shades. These can work all year round, really, but the cool tones really just fit the mood of Fall, don't they?</p>
<p>This shade of pink gives the most natural looking flush to the cheeks on my skin tone and I have collected quite a few over the years. Three of my favorites are the ones you've seen above: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTALFD4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00DTALFD4&amp;linkId=83affd2b70d82c3b59e86e31157c2b6f">Milani Romantic Rose</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/convertible-color?productId=VP12620#">Stila Convertible Color in Peony</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/84572?article=84572-Q">H&amp;M Powder Blush in Cameo Pink</a>. <br><br> </p>
