<p>What's "tea time" you ask? Well, as I'm not a coffee drinker (only when maximum caffeine is needed), I didn't want to call this more reflection-style series "coffee talk". On top of not really being a coffee drinker—I'm a <em>massive</em> tea drinker. Peppermint tea is my spirit animal. I also <em>love</em> a good London Fog in the cooler months. The gist is, I'm starting a series where once a week, I'm going to talk about something that's on my mind. It might be deep, it might be light hearted. It might be impactful, or it might just be me rambling on about something that's been rattling around in my brain. I hope you like it, and if you have any thoughts on any Tea Time posts, I'd love to chat in the comments! Grab yourself a cup of tea (or coffee), and let's chat: </p>
<p>Inner peace. <br>That sounds kind of heavy, right? Inner peace.<br>I’ll start by saying I have no expertise on this subject. I’m not a therapist nor did I study psychology, but I’m someone who struggles with finding her inner peace.<br>My struggle comes from wanting to do everything, and all at once. I’m never sure which path is the right to take, which project to throw myself into, and what decisions will lead me to the life I’m trying to design for myself. I frequently find myself stressing about this. Let me tell you, it can be pretty debilitating, and you can quickly fall into a hole of self doubt. Today’s tea time isn’t about telling you how to figure it all out, because lord knows I have next to nothing figured out. It’s about letting you know that you’re not alone if you’re in the same boat. I’ve had friends tell me “look at you, working hard and keeping up with a passionate side project, you’re doing the dang thing!” And while I am eternally grateful for these kind words and flattered that some may think that—in my head it’s a different story.<br>I feel as if i’m in a bit of a holding pattern. I have all of this pent up ambition (and flat out angst) that I want to funnel into what matters to me, but I’m not sure how just yet. I’m not speaking about personal details (I’m beyond lucky to have my family, friends, and relationship), but more what some might call my “career”, and what I’d just call my life. This blog was started so that I could write, and turned in to be my outlet for teaching myself photography at the same time.<br>The reason I tie this to the thought of inner peace comes in with figuring out how to get where I want to go. If I’m not able to reach a balance within myself, I’ll never stay on the necessary path, or make the right changes to that path. There’s no right way. That can be the hardest part sometimes. Being at peace with yourself allows you to properly direct your energy and creativity to where it’s most productive for you.</p>
<p>I’m trying something out these days: when I feel overwhelmed and like I don’t have the agency to change things, I’m writing down those feelings. Immediately followed by these two things: something I’m grateful for, and a small step I could take to get on track. This could seem silly, but even the act of putting pen to paper clears my mind. Even if I write nothing sensical at all, I feel better. Channeling my emotions into remembering what I’m grateful for helps to keep be grounded, and noting what I can do to change it shows me I’m not helpless, but being consumed by those feelings is.</p>
<p>I think we’re all trying to find our inner peace. Even those who wouldn’t change a thing in life (do those people even exist?), are doing things to maintain a peaceful balance within themselves.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips or exercises for finding inner peace?</p>
