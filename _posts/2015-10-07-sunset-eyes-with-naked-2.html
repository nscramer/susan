<p>Lately i've really been getting back into my U<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4040025">rban Decay Naked 2</a> palette. It has such a great selection of colors, a mix of warm and cool tones, a load of shimmery shades and a few great mattes. In playing around, I came up with a look that Nick so kindly says "looks like sunsets on your eyes". <em>I'll take it.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how I got this look: <br>As a base, I used the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chanel.com/en_US/fragrance-beauty/Makeup-Eyeshadow-STYLO-EYESHADOW-136738">Chanel stylo eyeshadow in Laurier Rose</a>. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/2015/5/26/the-new-chanel-launch-thats-worth-the-cash?rq=chanel">full review here</a>) This is a long-lasting cream shadow stick in a bright rosy-pink color, so it’s a perfect base for this look. I take this all over the lid and blend out, so it should be a nice gradient into the crease. </p>

<p>Next, take the darkest color in this look, Chopper from the Naked 2 palette, on a crease brush and blend into the crease. </p>
<p>Then, taking Half Baked from Naked 2 on a flatter eyeshadow brush, apply this color on the outer half of the lid, below where you applied Chopper. You can use the brush you used to apply Chopper to blend the edges of these two shades together.</p>
<p>Lastly, use the color Bootycall, where despite the name this is my most used shade in the palette (can ya tell?)—it’s just the perfect brow &amp; inner corner highlight for my skin tone! I’m still sad they haven’t brought this color out in a single pan. Anyways, with Bootycall, take this on the inner corner of your eye, blending it up onto the lid but not <em>too</em> far. Then, use it as the brow highlight as well. </p>

<p>Taking a very fluffy crease brush, I use the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.target.com/p/sonia-kashuk-core-tools-pointed-blending-brush-no-109/-/A-11909008#prodSlot=medium_1_54&amp;term=sonia+kashuk+brush">Sonia Kashuk 109</a>, blend out the edges of everything to make it a bit softer. To finish off the look I take a bit of chopper on a smaller brush and run it along the lower lash line, then slap on some mascara. I've started using (and loving) the Maybeline Lash Sensational mascara in black, it gives some serious oomph and length, and separates the lashes nicely. And <em>bonus!</em> it’s got a pinky-metallic packaging. Ahh the little things. </p>
<p>Well, there you have it! I think this is a great look for any occasion. I’ve worn it to events, nights out, etc. It’s a nice twist on the standard nighttime smoky-eye without being too dark. </p>
<p>Pair this with a peachy blush and a nude lip to really polish it off!  </p>
