<p>When racking my brain on what to write about to get my back into blogging, I thought of how I've always wanted to talk more about books on here. So, saving you having to read any more rambling.. here's two books I think you should pick up, if you're interested! </p>

<p>This book was not one I expected to like. It was a book-club pick off the NYT bestsellers list, which isn’t usually my go-to. I have a hard time with fiction. Not because it isn’t wonderful writing, because it is. Mostly I just tend to gravitate toward true stories and books on certain topics. Alas, I gave this book a shot and I’m glad I did! There’s a bit of (more recent) American history thrown in with some real family drama. The characters in this book seem like they should have had such normal lives, and in some ways they did. It’s a perfect quick summer read! </p>

<p>I’ve had this since it came out, pre-ordered, in fact. I devoured the book in two sittings, and I’ve read it another time since then! I have been a long-time follower of estee lalonde, the one of a kind gal behind this book, so it was a no-brainer that i’d love it! She talks you through so many of her experiences and shares advice based on them, but it’s in no way telling you how to live your life. As you’re reading you can tell the amount of thought and energy that went into every page. It’s an uplifting read and also helps remind me that nobody is perfect, and that’s what makes us all so great. </p>
<p>Rock on, Estee! </p>
