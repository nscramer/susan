<p>So you’re a work-a-holic and decided to shut the screen for one night? Or, you had rad plans but they’ve been rescheduled? Did you have a long day at work and now you need a pick me up?</p>
<p>Before you resort to trolling Pinterest or binging on Netflix for the evening (although both are appealing), consider one of these five activities to make the most of your clear schedule:</p>
<h3>1. See an outdoor movie</h3>
<p>Whether it’s a drive-in theatre or some other set up, it’s great activity to enjoy the warmer weather while relaxing and catching a film! You can usually find that these types of set ups are playing classics or older films that you haven’t seen—or already love!</p>
<h3>2. Drinks on a patio</h3>
<p>Does this even need an explanation? If you don’t have outdoor space of your own (or even if you do) getting a seat on a patio with friends to have a casual post-work drink is the ultimate way to unwind on a weeknight.</p>
<h3>3. Local sports game</h3>
<p>If your city has any major or minor sports teams, see if there are any games going on! Baseball games are fun no matter your amount of emotional involvement with the sport or team, and sometimes you can even find pretty affordable tickets last minute on a weeknight!</p>
<h3>4. Bike ride around town</h3>
<p>In Cincinnati, we just got a public bike share system a year or two ago, but I know most bigger cities have had them for a while! It’s a great way to explore parts of your city you may not have had the chance to before, and you can go for as long or as little as you like!</p>
<h3>5. Explore out a new park</h3>
<p>Green space can clear any mind, i’m positive! I’m lucky enough to live close to a few of the more beautiful parks in my city, but I always love to branch out and see what new ones we can explore! They’re usually equipped with walking trails, and some even yield some great views. Big or small, there’s always an adventure to be had.</p>
<h3>6. See free live music</h3>
<p>In most places, you’ll find there’s live music being played either at various restaurants and bars, and there’s something about live music that just lifts you up! Lots of parks and amphitheaters will hold free summer concerts with local bands where anyone from the community can come enjoy the festivities.</p>
