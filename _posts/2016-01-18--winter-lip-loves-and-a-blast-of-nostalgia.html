<p>Oh, Pride &amp; Prejudice. Some may know this, but it's my all-time favorite novel. I first read it in high school (and yes, I still have that first copy of it), and have loved it ever since. I've read it easily 20 times, and every time I am captivated by the characters and their story. It takes me back to the first time I read it, when I was nothing more than annoyed I had summer reading assignments. It's funny how you don't realize how much something will stick with you. I find myself picking it up every now and again when I'm not sure what to read next and want something I know I will enjoy. I've collected different editions of the book over the years, and this is my favorite one of my collection. </p>
<p>Normally, in the colder months I fall into the world of deep, bold, berry lip colors. I love a good deep plum or burgundy. But this year I've taken more to the neutral side of life and become obsessed with two colors that will be lifetime loves. </p>
<p>The first being the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/everlasting-love-liquid-lipstick-P384954?skuId=1736610"><em>Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick in the shade Lolita II</em></a>. This baby is gorgeous. It's described as a 'terra cotta nude' which is spot on. Slightly orangey, slightly brown, all amazing. This is also one of my favorite liquid lipstick formulas-super long lasting and easy to apply. It's got a much thinner consistency than some others out there which I find really helps to not go overboard and keep your lips feeling comfortable. </p>
<p>The second is the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod6010256#">Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm in Sultry</a></em>. This is a plumy brown shade that’s pretty subtle but still fabulous. The real attraction here comes with the formula. These are the most comfortable matte lip colors on the market, hands down. Since they’re like a balm, they feel very hydrating. They’ve also got this minty smell which is a huge plus for me since I love all things mint! This color is bold enough to be seen buts subtle and neutral enough that it works with so many different looks.  </p>
