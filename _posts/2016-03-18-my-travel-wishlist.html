<p><strong>Morocco—</strong> I’ve wanted to go to africa for a long time now, and morocco always caught my eye. The colorful culture, great food, and warm temps seem like my kinda place. With all of the markets to explore and a wildly different cultural experience than anywhere I've been, it's high on my list! </p>

<p><strong>Portugal—</strong> this is a tiny bit of a cheat, because Nick and I are planning to go there this year. We’re looking to go to Lisbon for around 7-9 days, and I couldn’t be more excited! The beautiful colors and breathtaking architecture are definitely a draw. I’ve also never been to a country that speaks portugese…nor do I know a single word… so that should be fun! I’m excited to learn some conversational phrases and explore the beautiful, water-side town.</p>

<p><strong>Italy—</strong> is there anyone out there who doesn’t want to visit Italy? I mean, hello, PASTA. Right? Right. And besides the pasta, it’s just seemingly an all around beautiful place. I’d definitely like to spend time in all the usual suspects of Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Ireland—</strong>This is partly influenced by the fact that i’m part Irish, and partly by my love of cooler, coastal places that aren’t necessarily a spring break destination. My brother recently spent three weeks in the UK and had wonderful things to say about Ireland, which only feeds my fire more.</p>
