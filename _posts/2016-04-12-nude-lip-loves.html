<p>Nude lips are quite in at the moment, with the 90's trend of brown shades popping up on makeup counters. While I love a good browny nude, I tend to lean more on the pink side of nudes for my perfect shade. We've all been there where we thought a color was going to give us an amazing nude lip and it ends up looking like concealer. (<em>yikes</em>) On my pale skin, i’m all about that hint of dusty pink in a nude. I also tend to lean towards glossy or satin finish when choosing lighter lip colors. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Milani-Color-Statement-Liner-Nude/dp/B00NBXW03S/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460489101&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=milani+lip+liner"><em>Milani Color Statement Lip Liner in Nude</em></a><br>A pink-brown liner that I tend to just spread all over my lips and either leave it at that or put another color on top of it. This baby lasts, I’ll put it on in the morning and don’t reapply until after lunch. If you’re putting another lipstick on top of it—it will truly extend it’s wear. I love the formula of these Milani liners, and they're under $4. <em>Win</em>. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4040047#"><em>Revlon Lip Butter in Berry Smoothie</em></a><br>I think I can speak for most lip product addicts when I say that the Revlon Lip Butters are a no brainer. I started with just one shade, and started picking up a few more each time they were in range until I had to stop myself. While I love many, many of the shades, Berry Smoothie fits my dusty pink nude for everyday category perfectly. The color is similar to my lip’s natural shade but a touch darker, and there’s some beautiful shimmer running through it. Very easy to top up throughout the day as I find you don't really even need a mirror! </p>
<p><em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/satin-lip-pencil-P378859?skuId=1478528&amp;icid2=search_search_p378859_image">NARS Satin Lip Pencil in Rikugien</a></em><br>I have a few of the NARS pencils floating around in my stash, but this one is my favorite of the bunch. This shade might be the exact color of my lips naturally, with some shimmer in it, <em>and</em> the formula feels great on the lips. Mine’s getting small; so seeing as we’re getting into my favorite seasons to wear this, a new tube will likely find it’s way into my Sephora cart soon!</p>
<p><em>Urban Decay lipstick in Liar</em><br>This shade seams to be discontinued(sad face), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/revolution-lipstick-P381305?skuId=1531961&amp;icid2=search_search_p381305_image"><em>but this shade is quite similar</em></a>. Probably the most pink of the options, I love this to pair with darker, more dramatic eye looks. I’ve worn it to loads of weddings and events, it’s really comfortable and lasts decently long. A staple in my collection!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5050009#"><em>NYx Butter Gloss in Tiramisu</em></a><br>I’ve recently fallen for the NYX butter glosses. I already have 5 more colors loaded up in my basket on <a target="_blank" href="http://ulta.com">ulta.com</a>. Pretty soon I’ll be doing a post on my top drugstore beauty picks, an these are set to make the cut so I won’t go on too much about them here. Just this—<em>you must try them!</em></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/lush-fruit-lip-gloss-P379098?skuId=1520709&amp;icid2=search_search_p379098_image"><em>Bite Beauty Lush Fruit Lipgloss in Cocoa</em></a><br>This is a thick, very opaque, shiny gloss. I’m in love with the color and the smell. I’m usually not going gaga over lip products that smell like cake or candy, but these smell like fresh fruit! It’s so nice. This gloss is a bit sticky, however, so avoid it if you’re going outside on a windy day. The color is a really neutral, cool-toned dusty pink nude. (could I have used any more adjectives?) But it’s great no matter the look you’re going for, and that bit of stick does mean that it lasts well; which is why it’s high up on the list for me!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/91304?article=91304-A"><em>H&amp;M Lipstick in Cream Chestnut</em></a><br>I’ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog//hm-does-beauty-a-nars-treat"><em>raved about this previously</em></a> on my blog, and for good reason. While the formula isn’t the most luxurious I’ve ever used, they’re still comfortable and look great on the lips. This color is more of a browny nude compared to the rest, and as you can see from the photos it’s well loved. I keep this in my purse at all times! Plus, the price tag is so nice! H&amp;M did really well with this one.</p>
<p>What are your go-to nude shades?</p>
