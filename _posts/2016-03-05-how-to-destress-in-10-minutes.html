<p>I might be one of <em>the</em> worst people in the world when it comes to handling stress. I’m completely awful at it. First off, i’m quite an expressive person; I totally wear my heart on my sleeve and my emotions quite clearly on my face. </p>
<p>I think most of us need to get better at handling stress, however. I also think that there isn’t a perfect formula for it. However, if you’re like me and sometimes are purely stressed because there isn’t enough time to decompress, I think this quick routine will help you. </p>
<p>Here’s how to destress your mind and body, in just 10 minutes. </p>

<p>Meditate: <br>Meditation is something I’ve flirted with as a practice before. Some of those closest to me swear by it—sitting each day, sometimes more than once. I’m not going to lie—it’s hard for me. Clearing my mind, sitting still, just breathing…doesn’t exactly describe something i’m known for. However, i’ve been trying to get better at it, and I’ve found it really does help. </p>
<p>There are a few apps you can use for guided meditation (something I definitely recommend as a fellow beginner); the most popular ones I’ve heard talked about are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.headspace.com/">HeadSpace</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>. I’ve used HeadSpace, and liked it. There’s a pretty cool set up on there called the Take Ten Challenge, where you meditate for 10 minutes 10 days in a row. </p>
<p>The one I’ve been using lately, though, is the <a target="_blank" href="https://us.rituals.com/en-us/app.html">Rituals app</a>. Rituals makes a range of skincare and fragrance products, but they’ve also got a strong brand concentration on meditation. I first heard of this in a blog post on Vivanna Does Makeup. I really like the voice of the gal that does this one, so I tend to gravitate towards it. It’s a simple set up with different length options, but I prefer the 10 minute one, because it pairs with my next part of this calming routine. </p>
<p>Put on a face mask: <br>Does anyone else love doing face masks but not love having to sit and avoid doing things for 20-30 minutes because you have a bunch of goop on your face? That’s why i’m loving any mask that’s 10 minutes and under.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origins.com/product/15346/10736/skincare/treat/face-masks/Out-of-Trouble/10-Minute-Mask-to-Rescue-Problem-Skin">Origins Out Of Trouble 10 minute mask to rescue troubled skin</a>. This does what it says on the package which is why I love it so much. It’s proven that what’s going on inside of you affects how you look on the outside—and stress all too often shows on my skin. I breakout, get dry patches when I don’t have dry skin, have excess redness, etc. You name the skin issue, i’ve probably seen stress manifest it on my face. This mask is very cooling on the skin, and really combats the pesky problems that come along with the not-so-relaxed moods. </p>
<p>I find that when I’m choosing to meditate, putting this or another mask with the same time requirement helps me hit two birds with one stone. I’m relaxing my mind and body while helping my skin to reap the benefits. Triple win! </p>

<p>Light a candle: <br> think this one is possibly my favorite step. I <em>love</em> candles. Love them. I love great scents and I love picking them out and having them fill my home. However, how often do I stop to just appreciate the scent of some of my favorite candles? Not as often as I should. </p>
<p>So, my final recommendation for mission destress is to light your favorite candle. And I mean your <em>favorite</em>. You know, the one you don’t burn as much because you’re afraid it will be gone too soon? Get it out, my friends. It’s worth it. </p>
<p>One my my absolute favorite scents is apples. Any kind of apples. Apple scented things, and I mean the <em>real</em> apple scent, not the one that they give to candy, brings me so much joy. Lately, I’ve been burning this one from a local boutique called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecandlelab.com/">The Candle Lab</a>, where you can mix and match and pour your own custom blended candle.  </p>
<p>Do you have a ritual for quick relaxation that you enjoy?</p>
