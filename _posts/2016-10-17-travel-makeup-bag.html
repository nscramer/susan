<p>You may know this already, but very recently I went on a trip to Lisbon, Portugal. The wonder of this city is certainly something to behold. The colors got me right in the feels. bright blues, yellows, greens, reds—the whole rainbow. Even being a monochrome lover, I was in awe of just how bright and cheerful Lisbon is. But, more on that later, I promise.</p>

<p>Today I’m here to talk about the makeup I chose to travel with on this trip. Being that we were in a city, so I knew I’d be wearing my normal face of makeup (even though most days I even went with less than normal). I was, overall, very pleased with what I brought along! I didn’t feel like I was missing anything, and I even could have left behind some products.<br>I have three big tips for packing makeup for a trip to make sure you have what you need and no excess: </p>
<ol dir="ltr">
<li>
<em>Do a first edit</em> of what you think you'll bring a few days before the trip and put that into your makeup bag. Over the next few days, only use that selection to do your everyday makeup. This will help you realize if you're missing anything or if there are things you don't actually reach for. </li>
<li>
<em>Hunt down those travel sizes</em>! While this results in spending a little cash, I find it totally worth it. Sometimes my favorite products can have pretty bulky packaging, so it helps to hunt down the smaller size. Plus they're so cute! Ulta and Sephora will usually have what you're looking for. </li>
<li>
<em>Stick to the basics</em>. Unless you have some big events during the trip, I recommend sticking to everyday products. If you're anything like me, when you are ready to get out and explore a new city the last thing you're trying to do is spend an hour getting ready. Especially when you'll be walking around and likely getting sweaty. Not to mention if you plan to pick up any new products while you're gone, you'll want room to get them home! </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, for what I took, let’s go in the order of application:<br>Primer: I picked up a primer I’ve been dying to try, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/travel-size-hangover-replenishing-face-primer?productId=xlsImpprod14521329">Hangover Rx Primer from Too Faced</a>. When I spotted the travel size I knew it was the right time to test it out, and I was pleased! I don’t think it actually prolongs the wear of my makeup, but it certainly creates a great base.<br>Foundation: Two favs came with me: The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/amazonian-clay-12-hour-full-coverage-foundation-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod4130103">Tarte Amazonian Clay</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/travel-size-your-skin-but-better-cc-cream-with-spf-50?productId=xlsImpprod11001537">It Cosmetics CC Cream</a>. I honestly only used the It Cosmetics ones! I put some of the Tarte in a little travel pot and just never felt like digging my fingers in there. Also, I already had a travel size of the CC cream, so it was an easy one to reach for. The other bonus—it has SPF 50—perfect for walking around on sunny days!<br>Concealer: I brought along a trial size of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/under-eye-brightening-corrector?productId=xlsImpprod11881009">Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/bareskin-complete-coverage-serum-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod12991091">Bare Minerals Complete Coverage Serum</a> concealer I’ve been loving lately.<br>Powder: skipped it! I know. right? I didn’t even miss it either..<br>Brows: You won’t be surprised here either, the ABH brow powder in taupe along with the ABH clear brow gel made the cut.<br>Bronzer: My ever faithful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/amazonian-clay-waterproof-bronzer?productId=xlsImpprod2430059">Tarte Amazonian Clay bronzer in Park Ave Princess</a>. The one that looks very dark and very shimmery in the pan, but somehow ends up being the perfect bronzer for me when applied! I picked up a fresh one for this trip and it was lovely.<br>Blush: I had a few options, but you had to guess <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/naughty-nudes-amazonian-clay-12-hour-blush-collection?productId=prod14401031#">Tarte’s Exposed</a> was coming along. It goes with everything! It’s a beautiful shade that you just cannot go wrong with. My second blush option was within the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/the-perfect-all-in-one-palette-for-fall">Lorac Refined Romance Palette</a>, which is a deeper more berry toned shade.<br>Highlight: I went with a trial size of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/shimmering-skin-perfector-poured?productId=xlsImpprod12801029">Becca Shimmering Skin Perfecter Poured</a> in the shade Opal, and then the two highlights in that Lorac palette. I used the golden one from the palette most often! Opal is a bit intense for me, and the poured formula can be pretty hard to blend. I do like it, but i’m glad I’ve got the small one as I’d never be able to use up a big one!<br>Eyeshadow: I stuck with just the Lorac palette, as it has all I’d need! Now, I did pick up a decent amount of new eyeshadows while in Lisbon, but more on that in an upcoming post!<br>Eyeliner: Two goodies, both in travel size: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/tattoo-liner-P245205?skuId=1177567&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p245205">Kat Von D Tattoo Liner in Trooper,</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?skuId=1501311&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p379434">Marc Jacobs Highliner</a> in black.<br>Mascara: final travel size item of the bunch: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/deluxe-lights-camera-lashes-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod10921088">Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes</a>. This is an old favorite so I was glad to have it back!<br>Lips: I went with 1 red, 1 nude, and 1 pink. For the red, the classic <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/cream-lip-stain-P281411?skuId=1296060&amp;icid2=products%20grid%3Ap281411">Sephora Cream Lip Stain in 01</a>. And the nude, the one I can’t stop wearing, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/color-sensational-buffs-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod6340310#">Maybeline Color Sensational in Sin-a-mon</a>. And lastly, the pink, I’ve been loving the cool tones of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/multistick-P411038?keyword=multistick&amp;skuId=1855311&amp;_requestid=303931">Bite Beauty Multistick in Macaroon</a>, so it made the journey!</p>

<p>That’s it! That’s all I took. It does seem like a lot all listed out, but I promise it wasn’t too much once it was all packed. I had room in my makeup bag for purchases and that’s what I was looking for. I hope you’ve enjoyed this post, I really love reading ones like this from others as you really find out what products a person can’t go without!</p>
<p>What are your favorite products to travel with?</p>
