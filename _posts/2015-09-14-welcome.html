<p>Hello!</p>
<p>For lack of a better intro, let's get right into this: I’ve been writing aimlessly for years now <em>and</em> I've had this site set up for months without doing much on it. But, I think it’s time I define all of this a bit more. At first, I wanted to play around with SquareSpace and possibly find a spot on the interwebs to house my portfolio. Also, since my job involves working with bloggers using different platforms and product guys who build things to help them, I thought I should familiarize myself with the good ol’ square as it's growing in popularity and still quite unknown (when compared to something like WordPress). </p>
<p>As I said, for years i’ve collected my thoughts in writing. It’s always been a natural extension of me. It’s the way I worked through issues, kept track of memories, and celebrated wins both big and small. Lately, I find myself scribbling notes and thoughts more than ever, about all sorts of things. Some are quite meaningful to me and deeply opinionated. Others, are light hearted and sometimes about things you may think are silly (like makeup and beauty products). But nonetheless, I really enjoy writing about all of it. </p>
<p>When I started playing with the CMS for work reasons, I used my own writings as filler for posts and pages. It sure did look like I was blogging. I wasn’t promoting it anywhere. I wasn’t looking for an audience. I did like seeing my words in a more <em>real</em> home-and what goes better with words than photos?</p>
<p>I sure do love (amateurishly) taking photos. </p>
<p>So, here we are. Welcome! </p>
<p><em>Here's more specific details about howThe Desk of Susan came to be:</em></p>
<p>The name for this site was a tough thing. It really was a hurdle holding me back. I can’t say I came up with it. (s/o to my boyfriend) But I did however, completely fall in love with it when I realized what it meant to me. My grandfather, the most influential man in my life, was so particular about his words. He had a singular type of pen that he would use, and a slew of notepads that were personalized with “From the desk of Ronald Roat.” As a child, I thought it was cheesy. As I considered this name for my blog, I realized that it was brilliant. That’s how he owned his words, that’s how everyone knew they were his. So, I use this to tell you that these words are mine, and i’m taking ownership of what i’m now sharing with the world. </p>
<p>Before I thought I’d ever go public with this, I asked that same boyfriend of mine (a talented designer) if he’d mind making me a logo—just for fun. For sh*ts &amp; gigs, you know? He did so (beautifully, I might add), I added it here, and realized I was kind of in love with the idea of blogging. (Queue sparkly music and fairy dust.)</p>
<p><em>So what’s been holding me back?</em><br>What holds everyone back: fear, anxiety, self consciousness, being another voice in a sea of many.</p>
<p>I’d like to overcome those. I’d like to use this site as my outlet for all the thoughts and opinions that may or may not fit into my professional world, but are still encompassed in who I am. I’d like this site to be <em>mine</em>. And I’d like to share it with <em>you. </em></p>
<p> <em>Here's why I hope you'll come back:</em></p>
<p>On this site you'll find my many musings about what's going on in my life. This could include: items &amp; products i'm loving, projects i've been working on, my not-so-seasoned advice on various subjects, my travels, and much more. I hope to grow and learn in writing and photography through The Desk of Susan. Most importantly: I hope this chance i'm taking now, sharing this passion project of mine, will encourage me to take more chances in the future.</p>
<p><em>Now, for the corny bit:</em><br><strong>Here’s to new adventures. Here’s to embracing fear and judgement. Here’s to the unknown. </strong></p>
<p><br>Thanks to all who join me along the way! </p>
