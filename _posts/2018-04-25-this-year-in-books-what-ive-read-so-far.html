<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hey-o! </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Coming at ya with some thoughts on books I’ve read recently. I made a goal of reading 20 books this year, and for the first three months I was rocking through 2 books a month, thinking I would exceed my goal by December. Ha! April came, things have gotten busy again with wedding planning, and I’ve not managed to make it through a single book in the last 30 days.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That being said, i’m still chugging along. I’m currently reading The F Word by Lily Pebbles and Uncommon Type by Tom Hanks (he reads the audiobook himself and it’s just amazing.), and enjoying both albeit how slow i’m moving. But today I wanted to share a bit about what i’ve read so far this year, my thoughts on the books, and if I’d recommend them! I track all of my reads on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385884-susan-osgood" target="_blank">GoodReads</a>, come follow along, I love adding new friends on there to see what others are reading! </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’ve read a few space themed books, because i’m that kind of nerd: <br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20707975-space-chronicles" target="_blank"><strong>Space Chronicles by Neil DeGrasse Tyson</strong></a><br>I think knowing the author of this book can give you a clue into what it’s like! He’s a genius, and I love adding his books into my TBR lists now and again. This one takes a look back where the USA has been in terms of space exploration, where we are now, and what may lie in the future. I definitely enjoyed it, but it might not be that gripping to those who aren’t interested the topic. </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis" target="_blank"><strong>Artemis by Andy Weir</strong></a><br>Let me start by telling you that Rosario Dawson reads the audiobook for this, and it. is. great. I’ve gotten really into audiobooks this year, either listening on Audible or Scribd. This was a much-anticipated second book by Andy Weir, who wrote The Martain (another book I am a super-fan of). I loved the world Weir created, the spunky main character, and all the action of this plot. Like The Martian, this is about living in space. Unlike The Martian, this book is set in the future when humans are actually living in space. Well, the moon, to be exact. I got through this book so quickly, it hooked me from the start! <br>I highly suggest this read! </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25786523-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet" target="_blank"><strong>The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers</strong></a><br>I heard of this book in a video Books and Quills did around space books a while back. It’s a YA pick which is out of my norm, but I have to say I enjoyed it very much! It’s about an unlikely crew living in space, taking jobs to cut new routes through space. That’s probably a terrible explanation (GoodReads does a much better job), but I think this books really teaches the lesson to not judge people based on where they’ve come from, and especially not by the ways in which they may be different from you. I loved that the author included such detailed back stories for all of the characters and you really felt like you were on the Wayfarer with the crew. <br>I recommend if you grew up watching Star Trek and still feel nostalgic about it! </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A popular read, which normally wouldn’t fall into my hands:<br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation" target="_blank"><strong>Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer</strong></a><br>This guy was a weird one. It’s short, and I read it in just two sittings. I definitely found myself always wanting to get to the next page. It was weird, that’s for sure. My friends and I do a monthly book club where this was a book we tackled. I will say, it frustrated many people. There are so many questions, loose ends, twists and turns. I won’t even kid you by saying the ending provides any closure. Now, it is the first in a three-book series, so you probably shouldn’t jump into this hoping for it to be a neat little package anyhow. That being said, I’m still unsure on if i’ll read the other two books. I’m kind of okay with how this ended. I’m okay with not knowing the answers to my many questions along the way. I’m not sure if I recommend this book, honestly. I can say with confidence that this is far different from the film with the same name. It actually quite frustrates me because I noticed they produced a movie-cover paperback. But just from watching the trailer for the film after reading the book, they are so different. Choose your own adventure on this one, folks. </p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A book I think everyone should read:<br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now" target="_blank"><strong>Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker</strong></a><br>I have so many thoughts about this piece of work that there’s no way I could get them all into a coherent blurb in this post for you. This is about life and the world we live in. It’s about the progress we’ve made as a human race—and how we often times spend the majority of our lives concentrating on the bad, on what’s wrong in the world, and completely ignore the good. Pinker compels you to for goodness sake please look at the actual data pertaining to current events and issues before just letting the major news stations tell you what to think. Do I agree with every bit of this book or the perspective it takes? No. Did it make me stop and really think about stuff? Yes. It was so enlightening to me—not to get cheesy with the title. Most importantly I think this can be bi-partisan. Steven Pinker is who he is, and at times he can be quite polarizing, but he’s really just imploring you to do your own research and try to come to your own conclusions. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. I will warn: it’s a doozy. Almost 600 pages, and the audio book is nearly 30 hours long. However, worth it in my opinion. </p>
