<p>As i'm sure most gals who are into beauty can say, finding that perfect concealer is almost the number one priority as far as bases go. If you're at all like me, blemish &amp; redness prone, highly sensitive, with some old hyper-pigmentation and scarring hanging around—the right concealer is the difference between a flawless look and, well, a not-so-flawless look. I love Queen B as much as the next person (okay, maybe even a little more), but I usually did <em>not</em> wake up like this. (although I do dream of those days when I may not have to wear foundation)</p>
<p>I've tested <strong>a lot</strong> of different brands, formulas, and colors for concealer. I enjoy a highlighting formula for my under eyes (two hands in the hair for all my dark-circle sufferers), and a pretty creamy, full coverage formula for blemishes or scars.</p>
<p>There a few in both category which I like to keep on the bench, just in case I feel like I need them, but there are two star players which are very, very well loved.</p>
<p>The under eye concealer that takes the gold for me is the <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3510085">Rimmel London Match Perfection Skin Tone Adapting Concealer</a>. This baby is my dream come true. I've used it everyday since I got it<em>, without fail</em>. It's lightweight, but still covers the deep blue circles I get, and blends like a dream leaving the skin looking natural. It's also great to take this one onto the eyelids as a bit of a primer to cancel and veins or discoloration, as well as down the nose &amp; between the brows for a little extra brightness.</p>
<p>I don't think it will be any sort of surprise to hear that the <a href="http://www.sephora.com/radiant-creamy-concealer-P377873?keyword=NARS%20Radiant%20Creamy%20Concealer%20P377873&amp;skuId=1478361&amp;_requestid=75645">NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer</a> is a true love of mine when it comes to full coverage base products. It's <em>so</em> creamy, <em>so </em>pigmented, and lasts <em>all day</em>. It does take a bit of work with the blending, but it's perfectly doable with fingers, a sponge, or a brush. I prefer either a buffing or a stippling brush for this guy, dabbing just a bit over what i'd like to cover with the doe-foot applicator, then using a circular stippling/patting motion to blend it in, and building up the coverage when needed. Remember to start small with this one, since it's such full coverage—a little goes a long way!</p>
