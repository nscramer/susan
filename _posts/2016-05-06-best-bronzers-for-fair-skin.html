<p>If you’re fair skinned like me, finding the right bronzing products to help you not blind people with the light reflecting from your body can be quite the experience. Bronzers can show up orange-y on me when they don’t seem to have an orange tone in sight in the pan. I’ve tried many, many products to achieve that healthy glow and found two bronzers I recommend to anyone with skin tones close to mine:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/shop-by-line/honey-bronze/honey-bronzing-powder.aspx">The Body Shop Honey Bronzer in Light Matte</a>- This is it, you guys. It’s the #1 perfect-for-pale-skin bronzer for all seasons, but specifically Winter and Spring. I’ve been using it for a few years and nothing has topped it. It’s really light—so us pale girls are probably the only who can make use of it, but it’s perfect. It’s right in the middle in the pigment department, enough that it makes an instant difference, but not so much that you’ll have trouble blending it out. I like that I can build it up when necessary. This is the bronzer that makes people tell <strong>me</strong> I look <strong>tan</strong>. <em>Me? Tan? THANKS! </em></p>

It’s definitely something I can only use in the summer when I have some color. I do go light handed with this, but it gives a gorgeous warm glow. There’s definitely some shimmer in this one, but it doesn’t look crazy on the skin. I can't say I've ever tested that waterproof claim, but the Tarte Amazonian Clay products are known for their lasting power. Given the darker color and shimmer, I tend to grab a duo-fiber brush to apply, and while concentrating on the normal bronzing areas, I end up dusting it pretty much all over my face. Topped with a gorgeous pale gold highlight like Becca’s Moonstone, you’ll look like a sun goddess. I currently have a "deluxe" sample size of this bad boy and it's lasted me quite a while. </p>
