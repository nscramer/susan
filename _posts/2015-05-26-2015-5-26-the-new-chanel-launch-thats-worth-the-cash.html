<p>I was in Nordstrom the other day browsing around the half-yearly sale with my Mom and of course drifted over to the cosmetics counters. This is a dangerous place for me, since I don't happen upon the really higher-end brands that often (purposefully to keep money in my bank). </p>
<p>I was going swatch crazy, as one would expect, and the SS15 collection from Chanel caught my eye. I have already been lusting over the new Rouge Coco Ultra Hydrating lipstick in the color <em><a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/chanel-rouge-coco-ultra-hydrating-lip-colour/3960978?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=2029">Mademoiselle</a>, </em>but I hadn't checked out much of the other products for the season. When I saw they had a new cream eyeshadow stick, I had to swatch away, and I was instantly impressed. <br>It's called the <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/chanel-stylo-eyeshadow-fresh-effect-eyeshadow/3499002?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=5387">Fresh Effect Eyeshadow</a>, and it's my new go-to for everyday wear. The colors were <em>gorgeous</em>. There's a purplely color called <em>Campanule</em>, a green called <em>Olivine</em>, a blue, called <em>Azulejo</em>, a rose gold called <em>Laurier Rose</em>, and a dark bronzey shade called <em>Caroube</em>. </p>

<p>It's not as apparent when you're just testing it on the back of your hand, but I did notice a slight cooling effect, <em>very nice, indeed. </em>I got the rose gold color, number 127 Laurier Rose. When I first applied this to my lids, I realized that the cooling effect felt more like an ice cube being run across the lid. It. was. fabulous. </p>
<p>I apply this all over the lid then use the finger or a blending brush to blend out the edges. Either leaving it there or taking a light matte brown shade through the crease gives you a great everyday look. The pigmentation is top notch, and it's got the perfect amount of shimmer to make you look snazzy without being so reflective you're blinding people. Not to mention that this formula is super long lasting.</p>
<p>Now, these do come in a at a whopping $34. Hence why I restrained myself to only purchasing <em>one</em>. (But let's be real, i'll likely be back for <em>Caroube</em> soon, I can't resist a bronze eye!) Overall, I say these are worth the money, if you want a really great quality, go-to eye shadow for the summer. </p>
<p>Have you tried any cream eyeshadow sticks that I should get my hands on?</p>
