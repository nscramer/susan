<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4480167&amp;_requestid=2528729#">L'Oreal True Match Lumi</a>—This has quickly become my go-to drugstore foundation. I haven't purchased another since I discovered it! It's a medium coverage foundation that builds up quite nicely when needed, but always looks fresh and natural. It's not overly dewy, but just looks like skin. They've recently come out with this formula in cushion form, and i'm interested to try it out! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13501035">Loreal Infallible Pro Contour in Light</a>— Loving this! Plain and simple. Contour is a great shade and the highlight is beautiful. See a more in depth review <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog//new-product-review-loreal-infallible-pro-contour">here.</a> </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/clearcalm-3-replenishing-gel-cream-P265703?skuId=1263292">Ren Clear Calm 3 Replenishing Gel Cream</a>— This. <em>Wowza. </em>Its been working wonders on my weird winter skin. My skin is usually combo-oily but really goes wacky in the winter and is basically dry + oily at the same time. I like to step up the moisturizer game during the colder months to combat this and this Ren offering has been perfect. It’s meant to be used to replenish skin that’s also being treated with anti-acne products, so that’s a huge bonus for me, as my normal breakout-banishing products can leave my poor face pretty parched.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3330153#">Tarte Amazonian Clay Blush in Peaceful</a>- This is a deluxe size sample I’ve had for a long time. It’s a bit warmer than I’d usually go for in the winter, but I think the warmth is exactly what my complexion needs right now! It's a pinky apricot shade with some gold shimmer running through which I think would suit many skin tones, but it doesn't overpower me and my paleness. </p>

They're masks you keep in the fridge to keep cool which lets them give an amazing sensation when applied to your skin. This mask smells like a divine bunch of roses (due to the rose clay present) and also has calamine in it to really soothe an aggravated complexion. I find it's perfect for a small pamper session and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I slap a thick layer on, let it dry, then gently remove with a damp cloth.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1455819485114_8531"><a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.danielwellington.com/us/classic-sheffield-lady" href="https://www.danielwellington.com/us/classic-sheffield-lady">Daniel Wellington Classic Sheffield in Silver</a>—This was a Christmas gift from my lovely boyfriend. (although he'd tell you Santa got it for me) I was really amazed when I unwrapped this beauty. I've been eyeing it up for a long time, but never really said much about it. That's good researching, Nick! I love how classy it is. Simple, no fuss, and looks stunning with any outfit. I wear it when i'm getting all dolled up or with jeans + trainers. It's a staple for those who need a watch that looks great and can be worn everyday without fail. </p>
