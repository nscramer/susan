<p>Yesterday was my twenty-fifth birthday. Wowza! I used to think 25 was <em>so</em> old. I remember when my oldest cousin was this age, and I thought she was so cool and independent. (She still is, btw). I just never imagined this day would come back then! </p>
<p>You always have visions while growing up about what being an “adult” would be like. I can tell you, I couldn’t have predicted this at all. </p>
<p>I’m 25. I have a loving and fulfilling relationship, an amazing dog, a career I can work hard at, a family who’s there for me always, and amazing friends. These people all chose to gather with me and celebrate this milestone with me, and I was unable to stop from getting a bit sappy. There’s so much going on in the world today. It’s an ugly, terrifying place in some respects. But in others, it’s bright and full of potential. I don’t force myself to step back and look at it all often enough, I don’t think anyone does. </p>
<p>At this point in my life there are challenges, but they’re nothing I can’t handle—nothing that i’m not excited to face head-on. I’ve travelled, read, danced, cried, loved, and laughed through 25 years of life, and for that I am grateful. </p>
<p>I wanted to spend time today addressing my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/30-before-25/">30 before 25</a> list. As you may know, I was able to cross a good amount off of that list, but, I didn’t complete it—yet. Here’s the thing about this list. I set out with high hopes. If you check it out, you’ll see I created it when I graduated college. I was 21 then. Needless to say, goals change! I did amend the list slightly as time went on, but there were some things on there that I didn’t get to. Some I should have, but some I feel okay about missing. </p>
<p>Will I create another list? <em>Yes.</em> Will it likely have some items that are migrated from the old list? <em>Yes. </em></p>
<p><strong>Here’s a look at what I completed: </strong></p>
<p>Attend a music festival (Midpoint Music Festival, October 2014)<br>Move into my own apartment (March 2014)<br>Land a job I enjoy and take pride in (January 2014)<br>Travel to France (October 2014)<br>Write for the blog twice a week (with a one month benchmark to create the habit) (March + April 2016)<br>Contribute writing to another blog (The Ahalogy blog; multiple)<br>Create a manageable workout regimen that makes me feel great. (began training with Jill in Dec. 2014)<br>Grow my hair out to mid-back length (it's about there, i'd say! April 2015) (and I just cut it off! HA! July, 2016)<br>Get a dog ([Fitz came home in August 2015!)<br>Visit NYC (April 2014)<br>Clean out closet and donate what I don't keep (Cut clothing in half in Jan. 2014) <br>Read 30 new books<br>Make spaghetti squash (April 2015—NO idea what took me so long!)<br>Get a nice camera and put more time into taking photos—dreaming of the Olympus Pen E-PL7 (JULY 2015, Olympus Pen E-PL7 Purchased!)<br>Visit San Fransisco (May 2014) <br>Lead a major project start to finish (work) (Brand Voice and Tone Guide, Jan. 2014)<br>Visit Harry Potter World at Universal Studios (Went with my mom in Oct. 2015!)</p>
<p><strong>And, what I didn’t: </strong></p>
<p>Buy a new (personal) apple computer<br>Purchase the top 10 items on my high-end beauty wishlist<br>Visit Seattle<br>Take Nick to Denver<br>See Dave Matthews Band at the Gorge<br>Create my dream home office space<br>Take my mom to Europe or Belize<br>Read every Hemingway novel (The Old Man and The Sea, The Sun Also Rises,)<br>Run a 10k<br>Create a "Before I Die..." wall in Cincinnati and maintain it for a month.</p>
<p>There are some things on there that were definitely attainable, but in a few instances I let life take me different directions. I feel great about what I did accomplish and how I was able to use this list to guide where I spent my time (and funds) through the last four years. </p>
<p>I’m hoping to my next list out very soon. And I think i’ll be extending this one to 30. <strong>30?</strong> <em>Weird</em>. <br>I’m excited to reveal that once it’s all completed!</p>
<p>Cheers my friends, to 25 great years past and many more to come! </p>
<p><em>PS—Stay tuned for a photo diary post from my birthday celebrations coming this week! I had an amazing time with some of my best friends and family. I couldn't be more thankful for the people I have in my life, they make it all worth it! </em></p>
