<p>Hey there, it's me. It's been quite some time, hasn't it? I could start to explain, but I'll save us all that 2 minutes of our lives. </p>
<p>Let's jump right in: Skincare! I have a confession, guys: I've pretty much stopped buying makeup. EEK. I said it. Not because I don't love it anymore, and not because I don't love testing products anymore. There are a few reasons, the main one comes down to trying to use up as much of my current collection before I keep adding more. (You can laugh, that's okay, I am chuckling a bit myself. See you next week in a makeup haul post) In that same vein, I've really been concentrating on my skin. What's the use in all this makeup if my skin isn't the best canvas it could be? Also, wearing full-coverage products on a regular basis is the pits. Also, not that 25 is anywhere close to being an age to worry about aging in the general sense—it's <em>never </em>too early to start taking care of your skin.</p>

<p>I assume, since you've landed on a blog post about skincare, you might have heard of this new brand that's blowing up in the beauty world—<a target="_blank" href="http://theordinary.com/">The Ordinary</a>. This brand is owned by the EU skincare company, <a target="_blank" href="http://deciem.com/">Deciem</a>. They have quite the portfolio of skincare lines, some of which i'm sure you've heard of. The Ordinary was created to bring quality, proven ingredients to us without all the faff that results in those high price tags that give you heart palpitations. There's a wide range for many concerns, I highly recommend checking out their site and giving a read to the product descriptions, there's something for everyone. </p>
<p>I have a few issues i'm targeting right now: dark under eye circles, dryness, and hyper-pigmentation/acne scars. I chose three of their products that (surprise) target just those issues! </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-alpha-arbutin-2pct-ha-30ml">Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA</a>: This baby is for lightening the appearance of pigmentation and brightening the skin, with a bit of hyaluronic acid in there to give your face a drink of water. I use this in the morning (make sure you use SPF if you do this!) on clean skin. I've noticed spots from recent breakouts fading <em>much</em> faster than I'm used to, and my skin feels nice and hydrated after this. </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-caffeine-solution-5pct-egcg-30ml">Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG</a>: I'm using this AM + PM as an eye serum. It's been about a month, and I do like it. I think it plumps up and hydrates the skin under my peepers, but I'm not quite sold on the reduction of dark circles just yet. Stay tuned on that benefit.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-buffet-30ml">"Buffet"</a>: This one is <em>all</em> about anti-aging. It's <strong>packed<em> </em></strong>with peptides, amino acids, and hyaluronic acid. All good things for all ages, really. This is one of their pricer offerings (although still only coming in at $14.80), but I'm totally loving it. I use this as my PM serum and my skin drinks it up. </p>
<p>So, there you go! I will absolutely be trying more products from the brand, I'm really impressed with their quality, packaging, marketing—the works. Here's looking at you, Deciem. Well done. </p>
