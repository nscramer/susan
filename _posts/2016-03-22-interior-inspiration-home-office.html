<p>I’ve been wanting to make my dream home office space for a long time now. I even have it as a goal on my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/30-before-25/">30 before 25</a> list! <br>Last year, I bought a vanity table to help store my makeup collection as well as serve as a workspace for when I am working from home. While this table has worked up until this point, it’s gotten rather messy, and I’ve noticed some things I don’t love about it, like it’s size and the inability to cross my legs while sitting at it. I know that might sound crazy, but it’s <em>super</em> important to me. I find that I get really stiff legs and knees if I can't move them around by crossing and uncrossing while i'm working. It’s like the shoulder test with handbags, ya know? If I can’t cross my legs comfortably while sitting at a desk, it won’t work out for me over any long period of time. Because of this, I haven’t been using this vanity for working, which means I really only sit there for about 20 mins each day.</p>
<p>Here's my current set up:</p>

<p>I also realized quickly that while white wood is bright and pretty, I don’t really enjoy it. I much prefer natural wood colors as they don’t show wear as quickly. All of this has led me back to the hunt for a great desk. I’ve gone back and forth on if I want built in storage or something on the side, and I think i’ve settled on supplemental storage. While it would be nice to have drawers for my daily makeup, I’m just not finding something that really fits the bill with that requirement. I think i’ve honed in on the desk I’d like—surprise it’s IKEA—and the storage i’d like to go with it</p>
<p>Before I make any purchases, though, i’m really torture testing the whole picture as best I can. I want to make sure i’m not going to be unhappy with my pieces a year from now. I’m envisioning natural wood, with mixes of white, grey, black, and pops of metallic.</p>
<p>Here's my inspiration for redoing my workspace: </p>
