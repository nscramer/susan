<p>Everyone knows that contouring and highlighting have been all the rage as of late. While I like a lil’ sculpt for a night out, i’m definitely not one to do this on a daily basis. I do, however, firmly stand behind a nice glowy complexion to make a gal look healthy. I have very oily skin. Let me repeat: <em>very oily</em>. I’ve also got some dehydrated patches, it’s very sensitive, and breakout-prone. Joy! While I tend to lean more towards fuller coverage matte finish foundations, there are a few lighter &amp; dewier ones I enjoy slapping on from time to time as well. No matter the coverage and finish, I always use this one tactic when i’m looking for a lit from within—not disco ball—glow.</p>
<p>The (not-so) secret?: Applying both highlighter and blush<em> underneath </em>your foundation.</p>
<p>Won’t the foundation just cover it up, you ask? That depends on the products and colors you use.</p>
<h3>For the full coverage &amp; matte foundations:</h3>
<p>Since this foundation’s job is to combat shine and discoloration, I go a <em>little</em> bit clowny, but only for a moment. For this, I like using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5050023">NYX Born To Glow liquid illuminator in the shade Sunbeam</a>. This is a very cool toned, pale pink highlight with serious sheen and shimmer. There’s also a hint of glitter in it (which is why I don’t use it on top of a base). For blush, I go for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4141583#">NXY </a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4141583#">Rouge Cream Blush in the shade Glow</a>. It’s quite the bright pink, and does look scary at first, there’s no denying. I apply this either with a small stippling brush or just my fingertips, and blend it out. Here’s where you look like a clown for those few moments. After that’s all sorted, I go in with the foundation, usually the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4130103">Tarte Amazonian Clay</a> (seriously has magical properties), and when it’s all buffed &amp; blended, i’m left with a very natural, healthy looking glow and flush of color on the cheeks.</p>
<h3>For a more light-weight &amp; dewy base:</h3>
<p>I go for a more toned down highlight and blush, but still apply in the same way. I’ve been loving the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod11771035">Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue</a> as the base for this type of look, I like it cause it helps my skin to stay looking like skin, and sets beautifully under a powder. I’ll grab the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10921070http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10921070">Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10921070http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod10921070"> in the shade Moonstone</a> as a highlight. While it’s still an absolutely gorgeous highlight, it’s a little warmer and more of a golden-y sheen that won’t blind anyone. Sometimes I want to slather this stuff all over (okay, so I have done it—and loved it). For the blush i’ll grab another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4141583#">NYX Rouge Cream Blush</a>, but this time in the shade Natural. It’s much more muted, and has some beige tones to it, so it’s a tad bit warmer. These two products translate perfectly under a dewy base. Want to have the dewy glow without looking like you’ve just dumped water on your face? Try a very finely milled setting powder, like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5050061">NXY HD Finishing Powder</a>. It combats extra shine but still lets all of that luminosity come through.</p>
