<p><strong>Reading:</strong><br>Just finished: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812998898/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0812998898&amp;linkId=efe148bdaec78115139b87be351dad3c">Good Morning, Midnight</a><br>I really liked this book. First of all, it's about space, the sky, starts, and not taking your life for granted. So, I think we could all have assumed I'd enjoy it. I even didn't mind a total clif-hanger ending! Highly recommend. (if you liked The Martain, you'll love it!)<br><br>Just started: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061689246/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0061689246&amp;linkId=a9dce53532c274d46689c39a4828a38e">Stardust</a><br>This is my bookclub's choice for this month. I've been wanting to get into Neil Gaiman forever, so I'm excited to finally be starting! Will definitely report back on this one as I've been told I will enjoy it. I'm also tackling what's on my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/vacation-reading-list-2016">Vacation Reading List</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Listening:</strong><br><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3InXOgDxJPeA05l6rQyDoe">Relax + Unwind</a> Playlist: This Spotify playlist is what I've been tuning to whenever I have a shooting day. I tend to shoot all of my photos on either Saturday or Sunday mornings, when I can get the best lighting. This often results in multiple hours of photo taking for many different posts in one session, so having the right music is key. This playlist gives me the right amount of uplifting energy without stressin' me out. (does anyone else have trouble concentrating with super fast-paced tunes?) <br><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/seaosgood/playlist/2Bpx8AElGN73Qq732jRYc7">Dave Matthews Band</a>: an age-old favorite of mine. Lately I've strayed from listening to all their musical wonder in the same capacity I used to, but I always come back. I have a playlist made on Spotify which has all of their songs (that are available on there), and I've been selecting it often!</p>
<p><strong>Swooning</strong><br><em>Planning: </em><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U4LOQ3C/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00U4LOQ3C&amp;linkId=50edcf1c510a4f9914a3d10f218bf152">Filofax A5 Patent Nude</a>: isn't she a beaut?<br><a target="_blank" href="https://inkwellpress.com/collections/a5-inserts">Inkwell Press A5 Inserts</a>: I've watched <em>so many </em>"Plan with me" videos on YouTube, where I have seen many planners in action, and I think I'll love the Inkwell Press style best! </p>
<p><strong>Trying</strong><br>New things with photos! In case it went unnoticed.. <em>my face</em> was actually in a post last week. Shock! Horror! While I'm no where close to having it all set up to start doing more makeup look posts including pictures of my actual face and the products in use, I'm ready to start trying it out and finding my confidence there! More to come! </p>
