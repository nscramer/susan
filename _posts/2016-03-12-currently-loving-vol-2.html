<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13461005">NYX Sculpt + Highlight duo in Ivory/Taupe</a>—I’ve been getting a bit adventurous with the contouring, and seeing how the warmer months are on their way, I decided to experiment with a cream/liquid contour. I picked up this NYX offering when it launched thinking I usually like their products and they often have great dupes for some rather pricy options. I was pleasantly surprised here! While I don’t enjoy the highlight end of it, the contour is quite nice! The highlight just didn’t sit on my skin well. But the contour—it’s lovely. The color is really great for us pale gals, and it blends out quite nicely. It’s a doe-foot applicator that you use to swipe on the product where you want it. It’s pretty pigmented so it’s really nice to be able to be pretty precise. My current favorite way to wear this is to paint my face up with this <em>before</em> applying a light to medium coverage base. I find it looks really natural that way.  </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Lactic-Moisturizing-Lotion-Create-Cosmetics/dp/B00IJN6IEM/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457730273&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=create+cosmetics">Create Cosmetics Moisturizer</a>- I got this after hearing many gals on youtube mention this brand. I was looking for a different night cream, and I am loving this! It’s really hydrating and doesn’t sink into the skin as well as others i’ve tried, which is why I strictly use it at night. But the lactic acid and tea tree oil combo have my skin soft as a baby’s bottom when I wake up! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nars-duo-eyeshadow/2893797">NARS Eyeshadow Duo in Isolde</a>- again with the warm tones! I’ve had this for a while now (see a haul post where I got it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog//hm-does-beauty-a-nars-treat">here</a>) and loved pulling it out on occasion, but lately it’s been a staple on the days I actually wear eyeshadow. I blend the darker shade all over the lid and through the crease, then bring the lovely golden number into the center of my lids. </p>

<p>There’s a new book subscription service in my life and it goes by the name of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>. It’s $8.99 for 3 e-books and 1 audio book a month! Hallelujah! There’s also a list of “selects” every month which are free for you to consume. If you’re a big reader, you must check out Scribd! I’ve learned the power of audiobooks and how I read so many more books because I can listen to them when i’m cooking or cleaning. It’s been amazing! </p>

A friend of mine gifted this candle to me, and it’s been a big time love of mine lately. It’s sweet and lovely and I’ve been burning it nonstop! </p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457729574941_38569">Meal prepping- here’s something I never thought i’d be into. I’ve never been good at eating the same meal for multiple days. I love my tastebuds and they deserve variety! But, in effort to save some cash by avoiding Panera, Piada, the local burger joint, etc… I’ve been trying to pack my lunch to work. This has gotten me into the habit of picking one recipe and making it close to the beginning of the week then splitting it up for lunches. I usually do this on Tuesdays, as I work from my home and can use my lunch hour to slave away! I like to pick one protein that’s packed with flavor and get that all ready. I’ll get some cauliflower rice or spaghetti squash going as well. Then, each day i’ll mix up what sides I put in with that protein; sometimes spinach &amp; salad fixings, sometimes veg. It’s really been working out well for me, and i’m only getting more adventurous with the recipes!  </p>
