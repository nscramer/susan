<p>I haven’t talked about it much here, but I’ve struggled with skin issues for quite a few years. As normal, I had hormonal breakouts in my teens, that carried into college, and continued still into post-grad years. I got to the point, which I know many can relate to, where I thought “shouldn’t I have grown out of this by now?”<br>That’s a tricky place to put yourself in. Because yes, some people do grow out of teenage hormonal acne. However, the hormones don’t stop. Sometimes, they balance out and don’t affect your skin, but I am someone who is still affected by hormonal breakouts at 25.<br>I started doing the research I could to figure out what I could do to fix it, and that led me to the products i’m using today. Specifically, I’d like to share my evening skincare routine, as this lineup has given me the best skin I’ve had in a decade. Before we dive into the products: to clarify, I have combination skin that sometimes leans oily and sometimes leans dry, and all things in-between It's also pretty darn sensitive and reactive, so I know quickly what will or will not work. Now, for the products I am now in love with: </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/purity-made-simple-one-step-facial-cleanser?productId=xlsImpprod1490012"><strong>Cleanser: Philosophy Purity Cleanser</strong></a><br>I discovered this last year, when I was looking for a new cleanser to give a deep clean without aggravating my very, very sensitive skin. I took to YouTube (as per usual tendencies of mine) and two of my favorite ladies on there suggested this: Kathleen Lights and Casey Holmes.<br>I started with the sample, and to be honest I did not like it at first. It made my redness flare up on the first couple uses, so I dropped into my “idk what to do with this product” bin. But, something made me try it again a few weeks later, and for whatever reason I did not react the same as the first time, and instead I fell in love! This cleanser removes makeup like no other I’ve tried. Most days I don’t even need to use an eye makeup remover before cleansing. I’ll go in once to remove makeup, and then once more to double cleanse. I went off of this while testing some other products a while back, and decided I couldn’t get away from it.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://curology.com/"><strong>Serum/Treatment: Curology prescription</strong></a><br>Let me start this part by saying this startup is a totally cool concept. Tailored prescriptions without having to go to the dermatologist? Sign me up. When you sign up for this system, you fill out some questions regarding your skin, share photos of your problem areas, and explain anything you’ve already tried. From there, a dermatologist will contact you and formulate your perfect prescription. This is a monthly subscription, but you’re sent a 90 day supply every three months. This has definitely changed the way my hormonal breakouts are. They are less intense, and disappear very quickly. I also love this product because you’re instructed to only use it at night. It’s one cream, once a day. Super simple and a no brainer if you’re at the end of your rope with everything you’ve tried up to this point!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/kiehls-since-1851-midnight-recovery-eye-concentrate/3224183?origin=category-personalizedsort"><strong>Eye Cream: Kheils Midnight Recovery Eye</strong></a><br>This is a recent discovery, but I hear about it everywhere. It’s super hydrating for the under eyes and feels luxurious going on. My under eyes have been quite dry and sad looking these days. The bags are real, people—and so are my dark circles. I’ve heard this little tube works wonders on combating all of those things, so I am really looking forward to see how it works on me!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/travel-size-renewed-hope-in-a-jar?productId=xlsImpprod12191219"><strong>Moisturizer: Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar</strong></a><br>Another Philosophy number, this moisturizer has completely changed the texture of my skin. One of the problems I was having, apart from normal breakouts, was little bumps along my forehead and temples. I couldn’t figure out what caused them or how to get rid of them—until I tried this. Again, I started with the sample, and when I went off of it for a few days I realized the change it was making. All of those bumps are now gone! I do stick to using this only at night, even thought it’s meant for daytime use. I have combo/oily skin, and it’s a bit much for me to use under makeup all day. But I wake up each morning with soft, smooth skin, and it’s all thanks to this!</p>
<p>Have you tried any of these or any other products that you consider skin saviors? </p>
