<p>There are plenty of lists out there showing you great, affordable products or affordable "dupes" of higher end products. I would be lying if I said I'm not kind of addicted to reading ever last list of that nature. However, I've recently noticed that I do have quite a few personal favorites that I reach for often but don't hear talked about much in the beauty community. Today i'm going to talk through five of them with you! </p>

<p>The first one is a product I've been using for years and is hands down my favorite CC cream. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XCYJN2M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00XCYJN2M&amp;linkId=722d1dc7896bccd82e9124adcb4b149b">NYX CC Color Correcting Cream in Green Light/Medium</a> was, for a very long time, something I actually used as a primer. In my makeup loving journey, I've always been very into full coverage finishes, but I don't love the feeling of having caked up product. (does anyone??) This CC cream gives a light-medium coverage, and the green tint helps to cancel out redness—the main reason why I love it. I have quite a bit of redness in my skin, so I have always made use of green color correctors. This one is pretty cool in that it does come out of the tube green, but as you blend it into your skin it turns to a skin-tone shade and evens out the complexion nicely without giving you that weird green mask look. I still use this as a primer for some occasions, but It's also become my go-to weekend base when I want a lighter look. </p>
<p>Second, is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EUZE0I4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00EUZE0I4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;linkId=5c805123426b1687cd803e18b203b598">Revlon Photo Ready Skinlights Face Illuminator in Bare Light</a>. I either use this as a primer, or to mix in with my foundation. It gives the most beautiful, natural glow to the skin. It's not overly dewey or greasy, and skins into the skin nicely. I love using it on days when I'm just feeling a bit dull, like I need a pick-me-up. It's great for mixing in with a drier/matte foundation to give some glow without taking away from the matte finish. </p>
<p>Next we have the two <a target="_blank" href="https://colourpop.com/pages/brows">Colour Pop brow</a> products. I love both the gel and the pencil formula. I use the pencil on an everyday basis and the gel for special occasions, longer days, or when i'm just trying to have fuller brows. They both have great pigment, and the colors are spot on. I have the shades Blondie and Dope Taupe. Usually, I go for a taupe shade in brow products because they're the only shades that are cool-toned enough, and I do like a darker brow with my lighter hair. I got them both thinking I would love Dope Taupe and Blondie could be good to test out. However, the Blondie shade is the perfect cool-toned dirty blonde color that I'm actually reaching for it more! The best part about these?: The pencils are $5 and the gel pots are $6. <em>HELLO! </em>It's a no-brainer. The only downside is they're only available online, but the price tag still makes them worth it. Plus, Colour Pop has tons of other highly rated products with similarly low price tags so you can definitely put together an order worth shipping! </p>
<p>Lastly, I'll mention the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PFCT2R0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00PFCT2R0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;linkId=8b7f0f08221ac3f148094702a414b1b8">Maybeline Lash Sensational Full-Lash Effect</a> mascara. This was talked about quite a bit when it first launched, but thats died down a bit and I don't see why. L'Oreal has always been the winner for me in terms of drugstore mascaras, and they still hold some of my favorites, but this lovely little number has made it into my daily rotation and I continue to go back to it. The length, separation, and definition it gets is beautiful. </p>
