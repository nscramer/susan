<p>As many of you may know, H&amp;M has released their own line of beauty products! While this is exciting for a few reasons, I’m most excited to see if the quality compares to that of Top Shop makeup. I don’t have a topshop nearby, so another brand who’s very on-trend producing quality, affordable beauty products is a dream. </p>
<p>I went to my local store and picked up a few items. Now, my local H&amp;M happens to be located in a mall, near a Nordstrom. So, as you probably guessed from the title, I did a tiny bit of shopping there as well &amp; picked up a little something i’ve been eying for a very long time. </p>
<p>From the H&amp;M range (which I was very impressed with how many product they’ve brought out), I picked up an eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and an eye brush. </p>
  
      <img src="/assets/images/squarespace_images/static_5550fdcae4b08ed65a2595d3_5550fe2be4b0ff3767e072cd_56352c2ee4b0e32e6d5022c3_1446325300173_PA200594-1.jpg" alt="">
  

<p>Overall, I’m pleased with my selections. The lipstick is by far the standout for me. I selected <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/91304?article=91304-B#article=91304-A">Cream Chestnut</a>, a browny-nude with a slightly glossy finish. It’s very moisturizing and comfortable to wear, and the color is spot on what I was looking for in a fall nude. They had a huge color selection for their lipsticks, so i’m sure i’ll be checking out a few more shades. </p>
<p>I got the shade Wildlife in their eyeliner pencil. (which I can't seem to locate the color online, but i'm sure the other colors are amazing as well!)  It’s an olive green shade with a gorgeous but subtle gold shimmer running through it. I’ve been wearing this on it’s own to create a different take on the cate eye. It’s so creamy but does last pretty well also. </p>
<p>The blush I picked up is in the shade <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/84572?article=84572-H">Cameo Pink</a>. Admittedly, it’s a pretty similar color to a handful of other blushes I own. Nonetheless, it’s a beautiful muted dusty pink that gives the perfect flush. It’s not the most long wearing, but for the price tag I really like the formula. </p>
<p>Last but not least, I got their new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/12074?article=12074-A">crease brush</a>. I’m of the mindset that a gal can always use another fluffy crease brush. This one turned out to be a bit more tapered and not the softest, but it works really well for placing and building up color in the crease. </p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1446230174412_57664">Onto the little Nars bit that snuck into my hands: the <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.sephora.com/duo-eyeshadow-P0250?skuId=1099647" href="http://www.sephora.com/duo-eyeshadow-P0250?skuId=1099647">eyeshadow duo in Isolde</a>. Need I even say more? This beautiful pair have been popular in the beauty world for a long time now, and i’m not sure what took me so long to add it to my collection. The hype here is spot on—these two shades are all kinds of shimmery gold &amp; copper, warm-toned goodness. The formula is amazing as always with Nars, and i’ve been wearing these kind of non stop since I brought it home. Next i’ve got my eyes on their <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.sephora.com/dual-intensity-eyeshadow-P387263?skuId=1614403" href="http://www.sephora.com/dual-intensity-eyeshadow-P387263?skuId=1614403">dual Intensity eyeshadows</a> in the shades <span style="font-size:13px">Himalia and Subra</span>. </p>
<p>Have you picked up any new product launches lately? Or anything you’ve been dying to get your hands on?</p>
