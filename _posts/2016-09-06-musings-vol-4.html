<p>Hello friends! <br>If you're in the US, I hope you had a fabulous holiday weekend. And if you're in the Mid-West, I hope you spent most of it outside soaking up this glorious weather we've been having. <br>To start this short week off right, I have another set of musings for you! </p>
<p>READING: </p>
<p>Just finished: A re-read of Is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307886271/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0307886271&amp;linkId=2a3f0868b5ba334685611fa1f5eee59e">Everyone Hanging Out Without Me by Mindy Kaling</a>. Did you catch my Instagram post about this? (ps- if you're not following, get to it!) Sometimes, when I'm in an off-mood, I turn to books I've read and that brought me joy. I've also read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804138141/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0804138141&amp;linkId=f00fdd80de9ffdd8fa766552e8029512">Why Not Me?</a> by Mindy, but this specific rut called for her first book. I love her story and her witty sense of humor, it leaves me "lolling" for hours. </p>
<p>Just started: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812998898/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0812998898&amp;linkId=46fb217006b8f0e3edfabe4684f9b450">Good Morning, Midnight</a>. I don't have much to say yet about this one as I'm only on page 16. What drew me to it was—let's be honest—the cover showcasing a beautiful starry sky. Upon reading the synopsis, it seemed to have a similar feel as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018HIZSIA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B018HIZSIA&amp;linkId=538e0e895b8c03f0a769fc0519ec95c4">The Martian</a>, which is a favorite of mine. My mom ended up picking up this new book, and passed it along to me after finishing. Can't wait to see how it unfolds! </p>
<p>LISTENING:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3jK9MiCrA42lLAdMGUZpwa">Anderson Paak</a>: I'm not sure I can do him justice with any description I come up with. I really dig his sound. It's pretty different to most things I listen to, and we've been playing him over the speakers in the house quite a bit. Thanks to Nick, for this music discovery. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6CTTipcCa8RZX8aY0mttHa">Same Drugs- MisterWives</a>: This cover of a song I already enjoyed—has been repeated many, many times in my headphones the last couple of weeks. I can't wait for more music from MisterWives. They are sure to cure any bad mood you come across. </p>
