<p>Can I even call myself a "young pro"? That sounds so official. When did that happen?</p>
<p><em>I digress</em>. </p>
<p>When it comes to saving money, there's a million ways to do it right, and a million ways to do it <em>wrong</em>. Everyone has different opinions, and I really don't believe you have to be a professional or consult a professional to save efficiently in the way you need to. Whether i'm saving for a big, exciting purchase, a splurge item i've had my eye on, or just the monthly expenses we all love to hate-I have a few ways that I like to do things when it comes to saving. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not an accountant or finance consultant, nor do I claim some sort of authority on this subject. Also, I really don't think i'm by any means the <strong>best</strong> at saving, but i've gotten better over the years, and for now these tips really work for me.</em> </p>
<h2>1. Separate your checking and savings accounts</h2>
<p>Seems like a no brainer, right? Well, not exactly. For years, I used a bank that had a really awesome set up. I had a long term savings account, a short term, and a "spend" account that was my checking account. This seems amazing, money was very easy to move between accounts, and if I went over what was in the checking it would pull from the short term savings, then the long term. No over-drafting? Perfecto. <em>Not so much</em>. The money was so easily transferred <strong>out</strong> of savings, and I became really lax at actively saving more and more each month. I don't know about you, but for me it's kind of a mind game. I can't see <em>all </em>of my money, because then I'm comforted that splurge purchases are okay and I make them more often. I need to trick myself into thinking my checking account is <em>all I have</em><em> </em>and I am much more frugal. <br>So, last year, I switched to a different bank (the big switch was for different reasons) and to a different set up. Now, I have a much more traditional thing going. Separate accounts for saving and checking, both of which I can still access easily but they aren't connected directly, hey—a little separation is healthy for my moolah. </p>
<h2>2. Get real about your budget</h2>
<p>Budgets aren't just for squares, you can be fun and have one, too! While I don't keep a spreadsheet or anything, it's good to know just how much true disposable income you have. There are some really cool services that help with budgets, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a>, where you can set spending limits for different categories. I've used this before and think it's good, but I wasn't a fan of having yet another system, so I fell out of using it. <br>An easy way to get a birds eye view of your budget is to start with how much money you bring in on any given month. My job pays me by salary, so i'm lucky enough to have a steady amount. If you're a freelancer or working hourly, I'd suggest taking the total amount earned each month for about three or four months where you had a normal workload for you and averaging it out.<br>From there, start subtracting!<br>Take your living expenses out, your car, insurance, student loans, groceries, cell phone plan, etc. Don't forget to also subtract what you're putting aside for savings! (some may also want to include an IRA or investment fund, if you've chosen to go that route.) I also subtract the $200.00 I know I will spend each month on personal training. (yes, quite the expense, but <em>so</em> worth it for me.)<br>What you're left with is what you can afford to spend on things like eating out, drinks, clothes, <em>makeup</em>, etc. <br>If we're being completely honest, I tend to walk around everyday telling myself i'm broke. Even if i'm not, it's just the best way for me to make myself step back and really <em>think</em> about purchases and how much I need the thing I'm lusting after. </p>
<h2>3. You need to be doing short <em>and</em> long term saving</h2>
<p>Was anyone else ever told growing up that you should put 25% of everything you make into a savings account? Wowza. Mom and Dad didn't know that I'd grow up to love shoes so much, I guess. But really, if you're doing that (major kudos to you, my friend) and it's supposed to be your cushion so you can retire before you're 90—what happens when you want to travel? Or splurge on those Jimmy Choos? OR want to explore the wonderful experience of getting a dog? <br>You need to be able to save short term in tandem with saving for the long term—while still maintaining your monthly expenses. <br>I have a suggestion for how to help with this: <br>If you're like me, and need saving to be mindless (aka you've set up auto transfers into your savings account so you can't skip these, ever), you should definitely check out a service called <a target="_blank" href="https://digit.co/">Digit</a>. It's a startup that's focused on helping people save their money in a smart, efficient way. When you first sign up and sync your bank account, it analyzes your spending habits. Their system will determine your lowest threshold for cash in the account you link to it. From there, it will take small amounts daily and transfer the money into an FDIC insured savings account Digit keeps for you. Since it knows your threshold—it will never take you below that point. (preeeetty cool, eh?) Anywho, for this account, you don't earn interest. Which can seem like a ding for the service, but really, it's just as if you were saving money in a piggy bank or a coffee can, so that's never bothered me. Another really awesome part of Digit is how it bases all communication with it's users in SMS text messages. They send you texts to update you on how much you've got in the account, and how much they saved you each week. <br>I can honestly say I rarely notice the amounts they take out until I get that end-of-week message stating how much they saved for me. If you want to withdrawal the money, you text them and say so, and they transfer it back into your personal account within one business day. You can also save more than what they're taking out, if you want—just text them and let them know! <br>Frankly, it's one of the best things i've ever done. It's how i'm handling all of my short term saving for any trips or bigger purchases. </p>
<p>Again, i'm no professional. I don't have a degree in finance, and i'm not the worlds best money-saver or frugal shopper. I will skip coupons if it's more convenient. (oops, did I just say that?.. sorry.) But, I proudly (and hopefully not arrogantly) carry the experience of having put myself through a bachelor's degree at a state university, and it wasn't cheap. Somehow (and I say somehow because most day's i'm still not quite sure how I pulled it off), I paid tuition, rent, phone, car—the works—all while working as a server at a restaurant and still managing some semblance of a social life. Those four years taught me that taking care of myself financially is not only essential, but something i'm completely capable of. </p>
<p>I hope you're finding your way to figuring out finances, no matter what stage of life you're in! </p>
<p>Do you have any tips on saving money while still enjoying this wonderfully unknown stage we call our twenties? </p>
