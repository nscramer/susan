<p>It’s no secret that I haven’t been posting as much as I was. I was on quite the roll with two posts a week, and my editorial calendar was all pretty and neat. Then, life happened. Work got busier, I got stressed and tired. But that's no excuse, is it? Since when is it acceptable to let the hustle and bustle of everyday adulting get in the way of your passions? It's not. </p>

<p>The issue when you work long days on a computer and being a blogger on the side is that you may get home from your day job wanting to do anything besides continue to hunch over your computer. What I should have done, but didn’t do, was get outside. Take my camera and just walk around. Excursions like that, where I don’t really have an agenda yet I just set out to observe, are when I get some of my best shots and find inspiration to write. </p>

<p>I could continue give you a bunch of excuses to justify it, but it’s not worth it. Falling off schedule to me is more than letting down readers to me, it’s letting down myself! I set out a goal for myself to post consistently because I know, that if I want to grow from five readers (hi Nick, Alexa, Mom, Josh, and Tori 😃 ), to much more than that—consistency is a key factor! </p>
<p>There’s no way around the fact that right now, I have a full time job. Not to mention that it’s at a startup, which tends to mean it’s even a bit more than what pops in your head when you think of “full time”. </p>
<p>But, I’m getting back on track. I found that using this blog as my outlet really helped me mentally and allowed me to express myself in a way I don’t anywhere else. It’s pretty liberating to type up your thoughts and put them out there without needing rounds of editing and approval first. (can you tell I also write as part of my day job? 😉 )</p>

<p>Creative outlets, whatever they may be and no matter your level of talent, are essential to balance in life. No one can be all work all the time. So here I am, renewing my promise to myself and getting back on track. Tuesday's and Friday's—expect a new post on the The Desk of Susan! </p>
<p> Also, I hope you enjoyed looking through some outtakes from my first attempt at getting Nick to take some photos of/for me, I felt they are appropriate for this post, to remind me that this is a work in progress, and it doesn't happen overnight. <br>Note: they're outtakes because I could not get comfortable, not because Nick doesn't take good photos! Because he does. <a target="_blank" href="http://vsco.co/nicolasscott/images/1">Here's proof. </a></p>
