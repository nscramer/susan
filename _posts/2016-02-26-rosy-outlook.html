<p>Lately I've been very drawn to products with rose involved somehow. I've always loved rose scented things, but with my such oily skin in the past, the hydrating properties of rose products always scared me away. Now that my skin is a messy combination that i'm never quite sure what to do with, i've been really drawn to rose products to sooth the more dry and flaky parts of my skin. </p>
<p>I've been using the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_1_5_acs_h_2i_2602001011_11061931?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456238608&amp;sr=8-5-acs&amp;node=11061931&amp;srs=2602001011&amp;field-keywords=thayers">Thayer's Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera</a></em> in the Rose Petal scent for a few years now, as I just find it to be my perfect toner. If you've not tried Thayer's Witch Hazel and you have any issues with oiliness in the t-zone or large pore, you've got to try it! They have <em>tons</em> of different scents, and the aloe vera really helps soothe the skin. So, i'll use this morning + night as my toner step on a cotton pad, adding a few drops of tea tree oil when I'm having a breakout. I don't see myself trying a new toner for a long time, we've had a good two year relationship and still going strong! (P.S.— my boyfriend also uses this stuff and loves it!) </p>

<p>The next rose product i've used, loved, and recently repurchased as the warmer months are creeping up is the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/rose-hydrating-gel-cream-P378335?skuId=1516053">Fresh Rose Hydrating Gel Cream</a></em>. This stuff, guys, it's amazing. I originally had a sample of it in the fall, and when it got super cold I was looking for something a bit heavier, but it's so perfect for spring-summer-fall temps! If you're like me and can have an oil slick for a t-zone, but flaky, dry cheeks that makeup won't even adhere to (le sigh) this formula is perfect! Since it's more of a gel, you're getting the hydration needed but not slathering on a thick cream that can cause oil. The smell is divine and I find it provides an excellent base for makeup. I've got my eyes on the rose face mask from the line next! </p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1456236125050_63775">The last rosy addition to my collection is a bit of a pricey buy that you may consider a princess product, but I've been eyeing it up for the <em>longest</em> time. Oh, my, the <em><a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.sephora.com/creme-de-rose-smoothing-plumping-lip-balm-P254222?keyword=DIOR%20Cr%C3%A8me%20de%20Rose%20Smoothing%20Plumping%20Lip%20Balm%20P254222&amp;skuId=1223338&amp;_requestid=56461" href="http://www.sephora.com/creme-de-rose-smoothing-plumping-lip-balm-P254222?keyword=DIOR%20Cr%C3%A8me%20de%20Rose%20Smoothing%20Plumping%20Lip%20Balm%20P254222&amp;skuId=1223338&amp;_requestid=56461">Dior Creme de Rose Smoothing Plumping Lip Balm</a></em>. <em>Swoon.</em> It's every bit of the fabulousness that you'd expect. I apply a hefty amount of this morning and night (and sometimes in between.. :) ) and it leaves my lips so hydrated without being thick and sticky. Perfection. </p>
