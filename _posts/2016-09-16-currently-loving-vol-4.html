<p>Guys. We're already halfway through September. WTH?? There's only two-ish weeks till the Portugal trip—so this past weekend I got into hard-core planning mode to get content all ready to go and pre-scheduled for while we're gone! Don't forget to follow me on Instagram, as it's probably the only form of social media I'll be using while we are in Portugal. </p>
<p>While I was organizing what posts to write and photos to shoot, I realized I've been pretty exclusively using a set of products for a solid 3 weeks now. I do try new things quite often, but I haven't been able to put these products down! Grab a snack and a cup of tea—there's quite a bit to talk about. </p>
<p>I'll go in order of application, excluding base. I've got a whole post coming up soon on my current routine for my makeup base + what products I've been using religiously! The first thing I do after my base is brows. To be honest, I pretty much consider them part of the base since I can't leave the house without doing <em>something</em> to my brows. I went to Ulta a few weeks back to pick up another tube of my tried and true brow gel, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/clear-brow-gel?productId=prod2143893">Clear Brow Gel from Anastasia of Beverly Hills</a>, and saw they had this fun kit which included that gel, a dual-ended brush, and their brow powder all for $36 and I couldn't pass it up. The brow gel was full size in the kit and for reference, on it's own it costs $22. I do love a good deal, especially when it's on products I am repurchasing! I got my normal shade, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/brow-powder-duo?productId=VP12345">Taupe</a>, thinking I'd just use the powder here and there since I've been loving the Colourpop brow products. However it's become a daily staple! Having two shades really helps build natural looking brows, and the brush is pretty small at first look, but I'm obsessed! </p>
<p>From there we'll go to the cheeks, where I've been using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/color-source-buildable-blush?productId=xlsImpprod13521181">Lorac Color Source Blush in Spectra</a>. This shade is your typical pink color, a usual shade in my blush rotations. I love how creamy this powder is. It's pretty pigmented but builds beautifully. I also went digging through my sample stash recently and came across the cutest little sample of <a target="_blank" href="https://thebalm.com/collections/cheeks/products/balm-desert?variant=16601756166">Balm Desert by The Balm</a>. I've been using this as a blush/bronzer/contour shade. It has a pretty sheen to it and the color works so well just alone on the cheeks. </p>
<p>Next stop is the eyes. While I haven't been wearing this eyeshadow <em>everyday</em>, I have been using it more than you'd think considering the color. This is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/eyeshadow?productId=xlsImpprod4350375#">Urban Decay eyeshadow in Tonic</a>. It's an amazing duo-chrome shadow that's lavender with pink + blue reflects. I picked this up a long time ago but couldn't really figure out how to wear it until recently. I love this on the inner corner for a bit of intrigue or smudged along the lower lash line. It gives such and interesting twist to an everyday look. Plus, it fits right in with the moon child/fairy thing that's a big trend right now—which I'm totally into. For the lashes I've been coating them in the new offering from L'Oreal: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/voluminous-feline-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod14571031">Voluminous Feline</a>. I'm not sure this is going to become a staple for me after this tube is gone, but it's definitely great for some volume and length that isn't clumpy! </p>
<p>Lastly, a new (to me) lippie I can't put down is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/color-sensational-buffs-lip-color?productId=xlsImpprod6340310#">Maybeline Color Sensational 'The Buffs' Lipstick in Sin-a-mon</a>. This browny-grey nude gives the most beautiful wash of color and isn't too glossy. It's a color you don't even need a mirror to apply and will go with every look—it's earned it's home in my handbag. </p>
<p>Phew, that's it! Have you tried any of these items? What are you loving right now?</p>
