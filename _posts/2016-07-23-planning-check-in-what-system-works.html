<p>If you read my post from the beginning of the year, I designed my own planner and had it printed. While I did love it, it was pretty bulky, and because of that the pages would never lay flat. Now we’ve come to the point where I must tell you: i’m a notebook snob. I am super particular. Down to the point where I like a certain Moleskine in a certain size in a certain color. I also tend to like completely blank pages, although that could be changing based on something I’ll mention in a bit. </p>
<p>When I realized the planner wasn’t actually going to work for me, I was pretty down. I am very pleased with how it turned out, it just ended up not working the way that I thought it would. </p>

<p>I quickly switched to just writing in my trusty Moleskine and went back to just jotting down to-do lists each day. I was pretty bummed about the planner situation, so I did some more research on planner and organization tips. I still was unable to find a pre-made planner I thought I would really like, but I did stumble on the world of bullet journaling. And when I say world, I mean it. There’s a huge community of people who are taking the original bullet journal system, putting their own twist on it, and creating content to share their systems. The most notable to me was Boho Berry. She’s my inspiration as well as the inspiration or many others I’m sure! </p>
<p>Now, I am not at her level. I only have one color pen, my trusty Pilot V5 in black. But, I am enjoying playing with basic “spreads”. Right now I just do my own version of a weekly spread where I have a list of my events/appointments for the week, a to-do list, my meals for the week, and any overarching goals or inspiration I might have for that week. </p>
<p>From there, I’m doing a much more relaxed set up for my daily lists, sticking pretty much to the original bullet journal system of bullets, X’s, open circles, and arrows. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bullets: tasks to be completed</li>
<li>Crossed out with an X: indicates a completed task</li>
<li>Open circles: and event, such as a meeting. </li>
<li>Arrows: a task that has been migrated to the next day.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am finding I really enjoy not having a set space to work with for any given day. Some days I take extra notes in my book, and some days I do not. Sometimes I have an unusually fast growing task list. So, not closing out the day before the day is over, and just starting the next day wherever the last happened to leave off, works well for this! Strangely, that may be my favorite part about organizing myself with this system. </p>
<p>The only change I am looking into is getting a moleskine with <em>dotted</em> or <em>grid</em> pages, because it seems to be much neater and easier to stay neat. Normally, I stick to blank pages. I’ll admit, I’m so notebook-snobby that I like different page treatments for different situations. For work + blog organization, I really prefer unruled pages. There’s something about a crisp, clean, blank page that I’ve always found satisfying. But, because I’m also a cute notebook hoarder, I have found use for ruled pages in other areas of note-taking life. In this case, I’m willing to branch out and try the dots/grid. I am considering a habits tracker, like this one, where I know those page treatments will really come in handy. </p>
<p>So there you have it, an update on my journalling and task organization! Somewhat of a grey cloud to start with that has a shiny silver lining. A takeaway I hope you have from this is that trying things out and testing your ideas is always something you should do. It might not work out, or it could be perfect. I really did put work into creating the planner I had made, but I’m willing to admit I didn’t end up creating my perfect system! I only know that because I gave it a shot. </p>
