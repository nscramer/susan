<p>Everyone knows that fall is the time to whip out the deep browns, reds, and berry shades. In clothing, decor, eye looks, and (my favorite) lips. I have quite a few favorites I can't wait to start wearing on a regular basis. During the warmer months I fall deep into the nude lip zone, so it'll be fun to start experimenting with colors again! </p>
<p>Many of my go-to's are drugstore items, which makes them that much better! </p>

<p>In oder, from left to right:</p>
<p>Revlon: Raspberry Bite<br>A deep magenta with a cream finish. A classic offering from Revlon! I've had this for years. </p>
<p>Revlon Colorburst Matte Balm: Sultry<br>A muted dark rose with a matte finish. These smell minty, feel cooling, and last beautifully! </p>
<p>Rimmel Kate Moss: 107<br>A deep berry red with a matte finish. This one can be a bit drying, so I'd recommend exfoliating your lips before wearing.</p>
<p>Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick: Lollita 2<br>This one is lighter than the rest. It's described as a 'terracotta nude', and that pretty much sums it up. This is one of my favorite liquid lipstick formulas! </p>
<p>NARS: Scarlet Empress<br>Similar to Raspberry Bite, but a bit brighter. This is a satin finish which I like to wear as a light layer patted in with my fingers to give that 'stained lips' look. </p>
<p>Maybeline Matte: Divine Wine<br>A beautiful, deep, neutral red. This has a very matte finish. I love the wear time of this formula, although I do sometimes find it a bit gritty. </p>
<p>Maybeline Color Sensational: Deepest Cherry<br>A satin finish, and not the most opaque in color, but I love it again for the stained effect. It can be built up to be quite dramatic, which also looks beautiful! </p>
