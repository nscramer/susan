 <p>If you are into makeup and haven’t heard of these by now—go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bitebeauty/">Bite Beauty Instagram</a> account! They’ve done an awesome job with the release of their newest product, <a target="_blank" href="#">The Multistick </a>to generate some serious hype. Live swatching, showing colors used in many different ways, the works.  <br>I’ve been able to try out three colors (Blondie, Macaroon, Cocoa) , let’s see if they live up to that hype!  </p>
<h2>
<br>Pros:</h2>
<p><br><strong>Color selection </strong><br>The range of shades is awesome. not only do they range from dark to light, working with many different skin tones, but they are also all in colors that would actually make sense to use on the lips, eyes, and cheeks. Some are a bit bright and wouldn’t be in everyone’s taste for all three, but they can definitely work. See how<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BIpoYdMgN3W/?taken-by=thegalsguide"> Mariah Leonard (Gal’s Guide)</a> used the shade Nectar. I’d never be bold enough to rock that—but she definitely makes it look wearable. </p>
<p><br><strong>Formula  </strong><br>The formula is interesting and welcomed. Given that each bullet contains 33% powder helps it to have a finish that looks great on the skin, very matte but not overly so. I will say, it is a bit tricky to blend out on the cheeks, but I found warming it up with my fingers before applying to the face helped. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Cons:</h2>
<p><br><strong>Size </strong><br>The size of a tube of lipstick, which is all fine and dandy but if you’re using it in all 3 use cases then you’re going to run out pretty quickly.</p>
<p><br><strong>Lasting power </strong><br>This varies. They didn’t seem to last very long on the eyes, but really love the cocoa shade as eyeliner. On the lips, it lasted as long, or even a bit longer, than your average matte lipstick. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How I used these colors: </h2>
<p><br><strong>Eyes </strong><br>I went in with Blondie all over the lid and took Cocoa lightly through the crease, then smudged into the lash line for some smokiness. These blended well with a synthetic brush + fingers, as to be expected. I did try them out with a natural hair brush and while it was okay I would definitely recommend to stick to synthetic as you would with other cream products. </p>
<p><strong>Cheeks</strong><br>I’ve only been brave enough to try the shade Macaroon so far on the cheeks, it’s definitely bright but when blended out it’s a nice mid-toned cool pink. The interesting thing about this shade is the swatch looks a bit warmer than it shows up on cheeks and lips, so it was cooler than I expected once I put it on. Personally, I’m a fan of cooler toned pinks, but just something to be aware of! <br><br><strong>Lips</strong><br>I got ballsy and tried all three shades out on my lips. While Blondie doesn’t suit me (too concealer-like), I love Macaroon and I’m not hating Cocoa, surprisingly. Cocoa also comes out way more cool toned when put on the lips than you’d expect, and these are very opaque so if I wanted to rock a stone-cold brown vampy lip, it would be a great option. Macaroon i’ve been wearing on the lips a good amount. Again, more cool toned than you’d expect, but I’m digging it. Isn’t so bright that it overpowers you, and these last a decent amount of time besides when eating/drinking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, I'm a fan. I have a few other shades I'd like to pick up, but they aren't rocketing to the top of my wishlist just yet. </p>
<p>Have you tried these yet? What colors do you have your eyes on?</p>
