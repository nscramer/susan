<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">New year, new you. New year, new habits! New year, blah blah blah. Not to get too cliché  here, but I did a lot of thinking at the end of 2018 about how the year went. In many ways it was <em>the best year.</em> It’s the year I got married to my wonderful rock of a man, Nicolas Cramer. That in and of itself will make 2018 a tough one to beat. Yet, in other ways, I am a bit disappointed in the year. I won’t go into all of why, but let’s just say I wanted to make sure 2019 was more about better myself and taking steps <em>forward</em> in the journey of where I want to go. This means professionally and personally. To do this, I’ve created a little bit of a campaign (for lack of a better term) for myself for this year. I’m calling it Level Up 2019. I want to take certain things in my life to the next level. Not to say that i’m going to knock it all out of the park—I just want make sure i’m making forward progress rather than swirling in place and feeling sorry for myself about it.</p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m hoping to share some of this publicly, here. You know, accountability and all. So, the first phase of #LevelUp2019 (hashtags make it official, right?!) is to solidify a morning routine for myself. I’ve landed on the first iteration, and utilized some pretty simple tools that i’m hoping you’ll find useful in your own efforts this year! </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Go on, now, give it a read:</p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My inspiration comes from a book called <a href="https://www.miraclemorning.com/">Miracle Morning</a>,  by Hal Elrod, which was gifted to me in the fall of last year. While I enjoyed the read, I honestly didn’t implement any of it for a long time. Till January, to be exact!  </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And if we’re being honest—I’m not so sure that I’m doing it exactly right in Hal’s eyes—but the main point is to realize that how you start your day largely effects the quality of that day, and you should be optimizing the start of your days to achieve quality in life.   </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For me, I found three things that I started to implement into my own “miracle morning”: </p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Wake up at 630.</strong> The time itself isn’t they key, you can pick whatever time works for you, but it’s important that it’s the same time everyday. No more snoozing the alarm, folks! Consistency is key. It’s the key to success for a good morning routing, and  the key to healthy sleeping habits. If you can’t stop snoozing that alarm—hook your phone up across the room, set three alarms, use a wake up light—whatever it takes. If you want to set up a morning routine, you have to make sure you have the time set aside to do those things you’d like to do, and this starts with waking up at a consistent time.  You will also probably find yourself going to bed at a consistent time, to allow your waking up to be more pleasant, which then creates a better bedtime and sleep routine. Bonus! </p></li>
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Morning journaling.</strong> Here’s something I never knew I’d be into. I’ve always been the one to try to get a journaling habit going at night. I thought, you know, reflect on the day. As it turns out, I never stuck with it. I’d have other things going on, I’d forget, or by the time I got in bed I was so tired I didn’t care about capturing any details from the day. Since I have transitioned this to the morning, I’ve been sticking to it and enjoying it! I do a little bit of reflecting on the day before, I get out whatever frustration is on my mind, and then I pep talk myself for the day. Affirmations, guys. Get with them! There’s nothing cooler than loving yourself, <strong>I promise.</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Movement.</strong> If you’re like me, you wish you could workout in the mornings but it doesn’t quite fit with other things you have going on. In that case, I recommend a nice walk to get fresh air, blood flowing, and clear your mind! We’ve been walking our pup every morning for 30 minutes for the last 3.5 years. There are days when I don’t feel like it, when I just want to stay inside (looking at you, polar vortex that just froze the entire midwest), but if the weather isn’t horrible—<em>we always go.</em> It’s good to get our rambunctious guy some exercise and it sets a great tone for us to start our days. We don’t take our phones, we just focus on our pack. Training the dog and chatting about whatever comes to mind. It’s great time for us to bond but also to make sure we don’t just dive right into our to-do lists from the moment we wake up.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s it! How simple does that seem? It really is, that’s the beauty of it all. If you’re into meditation, that’s probably a great thing to slot into your morning routine! Nick meditates right when he wakes up, while I’m doing my thing, and he loves it. Before I had my morning routine, I was kind of just sitting around. I’d wake up when I wanted and feed the dog and then end up scrolling on my phone mindlessly until he was ready to go on our walk—what a waste! <em>I felt like a blob.</em> Now, I wake up, know what I’m going to do and I’m excited to do it. My morning routine has given me a better sense of purpose from the moment I wake up, and has done wonders for my mentality and self love lately! The simple things can sometimes create the biggest impact! </p>
