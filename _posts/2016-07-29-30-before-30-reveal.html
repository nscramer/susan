<p>My next goal list is here! </p>
<p>As mentioned in my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/twenty-five">birthday reflection post</a> from last week, I wanted to continue having a list of things i'd like to experience and accomplish over the next 5 years. I decided to keep it at 30, because currently that number feels right, and who <em>doesn't</em> think 30 before 30 sounds good?</p>
<p>An important point I want to hammer home with these lists: if you're going to make one, <em>make sure it's 100% about you.</em> That doesn't mean it can't include other people, mine does! I love the people in my life and I want to make a point to experience great things with them. But, I want to do all of these things for myself as well. When creating your list take the time to be selfish! Put yourself first. You should have fun with this, and you can't have as much fun if you aren't excited by the possibility of completing each item. </p>
<p>I don't have any lofty wisdom to give you on creating a goal list like these, except to think of things that will bring you joy. I use these to instill habits, push myself out of my comfort zone, and to remind myself of things I don't want to let slip through the cracks. I also use it to keep track of some smaller things I'd like to learn or experience. It was an item on my last list that led me to really commit to putting time into this blog. I wanted to post on the blog more frequently, so I put it on my list, and I have no doubt it was a much-needed kick in the rear. </p>
<p>One final note: remember these aren't set in stone. No one is grading you. If you create your list and a year later find there's something on it which you're no longer interested in—replace it. You're holding yourself accountable, but you're not setting concrete restraints. </p>
