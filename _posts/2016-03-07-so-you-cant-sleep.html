<p>Neither can I. You know how there are things in life you accept you're just not good at? Well, sleep is one of those things for me. I've never been good at it. I was the 16 year old who couldn't sleep past 9:00 AM. Even if I stay up late, I'm still an early riser. Those close to me will say they think it's because my natural sleep pattern is to go to sleep early, and wake up with the sun. </p>
<p>It's helped me at times, I praised this non-dependence on sleep when I took early morning classes in college. However, as an adult, it has at times become a point of contention for my sanity, so I'm trying to get better. For some of us, sleep is a learned skill, and that doesn't have to mean something is clinically wrong. </p>
<p>Before I continue, let me say this this: I have not been diagnosed with insomnia or any other sleep disorder at this point. These are serious conditions that can (and should) be treated by a medical professional. I simply do not get good sleep. I don't stay asleep for long, and I'm a very light sleeper resulting in waking up many times a night.</p>
<p>All this being said, I've been working lately to achieve a better quality of sleep, and I'd like to share some things I've tried that help, and things that are silly and did not help. Also, I'll lastly touch on this awesome technology that's allowed me to know more definitively what worked. </p>
<h3>What worked: </h3>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy "sleep” oil:</strong> My sweet Momma got me an aromatherapy oil named “Sleep” for my birthday this year. She knows my life-long struggle with getting a good night’s sleep. In honesty, my whole family struggles a bit with this, so we feel each other’s pain. Anyway, while this doesn’t actually induce sleep, it is such a calming, relaxing scent that you put on a few pulse points right before you go to bed. It helps me get into a much more zen-like state before snoozing. I've really been enjoying it! </p>
<p><strong>Black out curtains:</strong> this may be a no-brainer... But eliminating the light coming through the windows when you live in the city (or anywhere) is a major necessity for good sleep! </p>
<p><strong>Melatonin:</strong> When I’d tried this sporadically in the past, it didn’t offer much solace. However, when I made a routine of it and took it each night at the same time, I did find that it helped. Since this is a naturally occurring hormone in your body, it’s much better than some other sleep aids (which i’ll mention in a minute). There are so many reasons why your body may not be producing enough melatonin, one of them being stress. Being able to supplement melatonin, has been great for me. I’d recommend the lowest dose you can find if you’re just starting to try this—you can over-do it and wake up groggy. </p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://store.hello.is/sense">The Sense</a>:</strong> this may seem like an extreme thing to try, but admittedly, it’s quite cool. This is a sleep tracker which hooks to your pillowcase and has a sensor which sits on your night stand or dresser; these transmit data about your sleep to an app on your phone. The data you can find is both about your sleep pattern and quality, but also tracks the air and light quality in your room. It’s actually very helpful to know that your room might feel fine to you right now, but it’s a bit too humid for quality sleep. Or, springing for those blackout curtains to completely block out the light from your windows will actually help you snooze better. On top of all of that, if you’re really bad at sleep—like me—you try new things to help (hence this entire post). With the sense, you’ll be able to see if those crazy techniques you tried actually work.</p>
<p>While this can be a big investment for the average person, it’s proven to be really handy for someone like me! </p>
<h3>What didn't work: </h3>
<p><strong>Trying a firmer mattress:</strong> This is a total myth. Okay, so there is some truth to it, but it’s entirely up to you as a person and what type of mattress you’re most comfortable on. I have some back pain issues and frequently wake up very, very stiff. Trying a firmer mattress seemed to only exaggerate these pains, and actually made my sleep worse because of that. </p>
<p><strong>Sleep aid pills like Zquil:</strong> I only use these when i’m <em>really</em> dying for some sleep. Also, only when I don’t have anywhere to be the next morning. The problem with pills like these is they work <em>too well</em>. If you’re like me, and falling asleep isn’t really the problem, but rather staying asleep, these sleep aids may not be right for you. I was so, so groggy and out of it waking up after taking these. Also, i’ve noticed if you are keyed up from stress or excitement, they don’t work really at all, and then you’ve just popped pills for no reason.  </p>
<p><strong>Earplugs:</strong> I am the world’s lightest sleeper. Hands down. Living in the city, this is quite the issue, don’t you think? I make great use of fans to provide some cover noise over anything that may be going on outside, or just the creaks of our old, old house. I thought earplugs would help. And this might be just something that affects me, but they really just hurt my ears, and I never really got used to sleeping with something stuffed inside them. These may work beautifully for others, though! </p>
<h3>What I would still like to try:</h3>
<p><strong>Ambient noise machine:</strong> I have friends who use and swear by these! </p>
<p><strong>A before sleep ritual:</strong> many people talk about these as well as their morning ritual. Giving your body cues that it’s time to power down and go to sleep can help regulate your circadian rhythm.  </p>
