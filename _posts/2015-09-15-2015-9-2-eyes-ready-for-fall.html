<p>When it comes to makeup looks for specific seasons, I tend to think those rules can and should be broken. If you want to wear a bold, dark lip in the summer, or a really light coverage &amp; glowy look in the winter—why not? You do you, my friend. </p>
<p>Lately, however, i’ve been getting really into cooler, darker tones in both my clothing and makeup. Breaking back into my olive green sweaters and deep purple eyeshadows. There’s no doubt this is a product of the changing seasons. Fall has always been my favorite, and I am extremely sad that Cincinnati fall’s seem to be getting shorter and shorter. (we’re looking at you, climate change) </p>
<p>While i’m totally into these deeper shades on my lids (and the lips, if we’re being honest) once again, I have been pairing them with some more “summer appropriate” colors to help it be more of a transitional look. </p>
<p>To achieve this, i’m back to being obsessed with my <em><a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/mac-burgundy-times-nine-eyeshadow-palette-53-value/4012633?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=660">MAC Burgundy Times Nine palette</a></em>. If you haven’t seen the MAC "Times Nine" range you’re seriously missing out. (I believe they're exclusively sold from Nordstrom, along with a few other special MAC palettes) They have them in a few different color collections, and they’re only $40. Let me say that again: <strong>Forty. Dollars.</strong> Now, these pans are a little smaller than the full-size MAC shadows we’re all used to, but I still think it’s an amazing deal—there's nine shadows in there, people! </p>

<p><br>When I purchased this I didn’t think I’d get any use out of the shimmery gold color in the top left called <em>Gold Lust.</em> As the summer came through, let me tell you, it’s my most used shadow in the palette. You can tell I’ve made a serious dent in it. It's a wonderful warm, truly golden hue that looks so beautifully beachy. It does have a pretty chunky glitter, and I definitely recommend a primer or eyeshadow base underneath. In the Summer,  I’d let it stand alone all over the lid and a little on the lower lash line, tons of mascara &amp; done. Now, as it gets cooler, this is where the other shades in this palette come into play. Lately, i’ve been starting with that same summery look, but now adding some of <em>Haux</em> (bottom row; far left), medium-toned matte plum color, through the crease &amp; <em>Sketch</em> (bottom row; far right), a deep plum, in the outer-v. I'll always use a clean, fluffy brush at the end to blend out any harsh lines. </p>
<p>From there, I’m a creature of habit. Slapping on a couple (or 5) coats of mascara (currently addicted to the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod560124">L’Oreal Telescopic Carbon Black</a>)</em> and that’s my <em>almost</em> fall eye look sorted. </p>
