<p>Say hello to granny hair! Recently, I decided to take the plunge and go gray. I’d had light to platinum blonde for some time now, and I wanted to go for something different. It all started when I got the L'Oreal silver shampoo. I got this to keep the platinum color cool and ashy. But, it resulted in a happy accident: it turned my hair a silvery-lavender color. The product itself is a very deep, rich shade of violet. I was really enjoying the color I was getting from the shampoo, but it wasn’t very even across my locks and it didn’t last very long. (I try not to use the shampoo for each wash because I found it a bit too drying)<br>So, I hit up my salon and made the appointment to let the professionals take me to full-on granny. And I loved it!</p>
<p>Only problem is, my hair is now as dry as a desert. It was dry before, but man, this is crazy. With the bleaching to take care of my roots &amp; then the toning to bring it to the icy silver color I wanted, we put my strands through the ringer. So, i’ve been using some products for extra moisture and strength. Some are old friends of mine, and others are new discoveries. Here’s the lineup:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1451942903407_25047">L’Oreal Professionale Silver Shampoo:<br>As I described, it’s a deep violet colored shampoo that keeps all the brassiness at bay.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1451942903407_24401">Davines Nou Nou hair mask:<br>This is a new purchase recommended by my hair stylist. It’s a thick, creamy mask created from all natural ingredients and smells like black tea! It makes my hair so silky smooth &amp; was one of the only things to soothe my locks right after having the processes done. I use this in place of conditioner every other wash, concentrating it on the ends of my hair. I love this so much that it's hitting must-have status for me! </p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1451942903407_21627">Redken All-Soft Conditioner:<br>This conditioner has been a favorite of mine for a long time. The entire All-Soft range is fabulous. Not to mention it smells amazing. It’s a great everyday conditioner for the days you’re not using a mask.</p>
<p>Treseme Keratin Smooth Heat Protectant:<br>I’m not sure if this product has been reformulated as the packaging is different, but I’ve always been into the Treseme heat protectant sprays—they do the job! (and the price point is fabulous)</p>
<p>Healing Time!:<br>After doing a multiple process color session on your hair, it really does need time to recover. It’s taken a few weeks for my hair to feel somewhat normal again. Especially when you’re using bleach, you’re really drying out your strands so they need some time to bounce back! I try to skip the heat tools as much as possible as well to reduce the damage going on.</p>
<p>Tips for grey/pastel colors:</p>
<p>These shades tend to fade pretty quickly, since they’re so light already and sitting on top of bleach. Because of this, I wouldn’t use any shampoo that isn’t intended for color treated hair. If you’ve got platinum/grey/lavender going on, a purple shampoo is a must if you want to extend the life of your color. I’ve also stocked up on my favorite dry shampoo to help reduce the amount of washing so they color will last a bit longer.</p>
