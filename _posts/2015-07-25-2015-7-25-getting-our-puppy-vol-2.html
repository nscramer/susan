<p>As stated in a previous post, we’re getting a puppy! A beautiful, 12-week old male golden retriever will join our little family at the beginning of August. As you might assume, i’m <em>quite</em> excited. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we were able to go visit the breeder’s home and select which pup from the litter would be ours. Since we went through a breeder and a wait list, we were slated to make the second pick of the males out of the three that were born in this litter. This means that another family went first, met all three puppies, and then picked out theirs. For our turn, we met the remaining two and then decided which puppy would be our Fitz. </p>
<p>When we picked him, the two boys were six weeks old. When we first met the entire litter, they were three weeks old and quite the sleepy fellows. In three short weeks, their personalities developed a bunch and they were really starting to come into their own. </p>
<p>The first thing we noticed was the energy levels in the two pups and how different they were! One was <em>very, very</em> energetic and whined a lot. As we picked him up, he was kind of all over the place. The breeder made sure to call out that this is something that can be trained down into a calmer disposition, but it’s likely he’d be a very vocal and energetic dog. The other (also the larger of the two), was the most chill being I’d ever met at that young. He explored, seemed very independent, but was also interested in who the heck we were. He wasn’t startled by any movement or noises, and in general just wanted to hang out. We ended up selecting the latter! </p>
<p>Here’s some snaps of Fitz after we picked him: </p>
