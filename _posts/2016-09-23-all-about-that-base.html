<p>I know, I know, the punny title. It's been used a million times. But I still love that song, so I'm at peace with it. </p>
<p>As you can guess, I'd like to share with you my current makeup-base routine. That means foundation, concealer, powder, the works. My skin has been oddly dry lately, so I've been testing out different combinations and I think I've hit gold with this one! </p>
<p>First, there's the foundation. This oldie—and goodie—is back in action. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/amazonian-clay-12-hour-full-coverage-foundation-spf-15?productId=xlsImpprod4130103">Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Full Coverage Foundation</a> has been around forever, and loved by me for years. I had this stashed away because it is a thicker formula which had proven to catch on dry patches of skin from time to time. However, I recently decided to try out a trick I learned from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GlamLifeGuru">Tati:</a> add one drop of a facial oil to your foundation. I tried it, thinking it would result in my face being a giant grease puddle. However, it worked beautifully! It added the right amount of moisture to this foundation, making it exactly what I needed. It blends much better and still yields the great coverage you expect. Also, my skin isn't even getting extra oily by the end of the day, which I was worried about, so it's a win! I've been using this sample of the <a href="http://www.sephora.com/seaberry-moisturizing-face-oil-P374948?skuId=1448745&amp;icid2=products%20grid%3Ap374948">Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil</a> and I'm really enjoying it! </p>
<p>Next, the concealer combo that's gracing my under-eyes. These two from Bare Minerals are amazing options for those of us who have dark circles, but also are a bit dry under the peepers. I first go in with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/stroke-of-light-eye-brightener?productId=xlsImpprod4540225">Stroke of Light Eye Brightener in Luminous 1</a>, and then in with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/bareskin-complete-coverage-serum-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod12991091">Bare Skin Complete Coverage Serum Concealer in the shade Light</a>. The brightener makes me look awake even when I've had zero sleep, and the concealer is very full coverage but still feels amazing on the skin. Since it's a serum concealer, it's actually doing great things for the skin while hiding all your late-night Netflix binging secrets! </p>
<p>Lastly, another old friend of mind is back in the rotation. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/hd-finishing-powder?productId=xlsImpprod12011173#">NYX HD Finishing Powder in Banana</a>. I've talked about this recently, so no real reason to linger. I'd just like to ask you to try this out. It's so brightening and doesn't make you look cakey at all. </p>
<p>What are your favorite base products?</p>
