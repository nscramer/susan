<p>When I was a kid, I went through my scrapbooking phase as I think most gals do. (and guys, you probably did this, or something similar, too!) I bought the big book, patterned background pages, sicker sets, and gel pens. I had my mom take me to get prints of all my photos, and I went to town. I stuck at it for a short while, but as I grew up my tastes changed and I started to dislike my (full of stars and hearts) cover design. I had some great memories from making the book to go along with those inside. </p>
<p>As I got older I noticed myself keeping things. Random things, really, but they reminded me of an event that I wanted to be able to look back on. There were many different forms of this practice. I had an envelope, a box, a file folder. I kept <em>a lot</em> of things. </p>
<p>A while back, sheesh, probably six or seven years ago now, I really cut back what I saved. It came down to one pretty small item that I was interested in holding onto: tickets. I have tickets from concerts, sporting events, museums, plays. I have my registration numbers from running 5k’s, movie tickets, speaking event credentials, and plane tickets. I was rooting around for something to keep them in and stumbled upon mason jar my mom had once kept her friend’s homemade salsa in. And there was it was born—my memory jar. </p>
<p>As I began to travel more, I saved things like a napkin from a cafe in Paris and the bag our pastries came in at a bakery in Aix en Provence. I even have the key to the first place I lived with Nick, and the tracing paper from my first tattoo which was for my grandma. I now look for little objects that are about the size of a typical ticket, or that can be folded, at most events I attend. Those that know me can probably tell you about a time where I asked to swap tickets with them, as theirs was in better shape than mine (usually after a rainy concert at cincy’s big outdoor music venue—it <em>always</em> rains at the DMB show every year). </p>
<p>I found this is the perfect way for me to keep track of memories that I’ll never forget, but might not get to think about as much as I’d like. I had the best time pulling everything out of the jar to shoot these photos, everything came rushing back. I laughed and teared up looking at all of my memories. It was everything I wanted the jar to be. </p>
<p>I imagine one day i’ll need a bigger jar, or even multiples, as I don’t plan to stop saving these things. For now, i’ll just keep stuffing this one full until it won’t take any more. </p>
<p>Do you save little things like this? Do you have a system of your own? I’d love to hear about it!  </p>
