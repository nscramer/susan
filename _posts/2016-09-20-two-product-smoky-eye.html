<p>You guys. I'm pretty much giddy like a small child over this eye look because first, it's so easy. And second, the star of the show is so affordable I just can't get over it. Enter: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/flawless-eyeshadow?dept=eye-eyeshadow&amp;color_id=10810">Elf Flawless Eyeshadow Quad in Tantalizing Taupe</a>. This is two dollars. Two. Stinking. Dollars!! I was gifted this, but I will be hunting down the other quads in this line to purchase. I did a quick post on Instagram talking about this product, but I love it so much I had to feature it on the blog as well! </p>
<p>The colors are a neutral lovers dream and perfect for anyone who's looking to just get some basic eyeshadows to use for everyday. The formula is fantastic as well. They're pigmented, blend really well and do not crease. I kid you not—they <strong>do not</strong> crease! I have worn this for an entire day and at the end, the shadows look the same as they did when I put them on first thing. </p>
<p>My favorite way to wear this, creating a neutral smoky eye out of just two products, goes a little something like this:<br>Top shade: a beautiful champagne color all over the lid, under brow, and inner corner. <br>Second shade: mid toned brown all through the crease and along the lower lash line. <br>Third shade: darker brown, blended through the crease as well but focused on the outer-v of the eyelid. <br>Fourth shade: used to set in a subtle wing liner created initially with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/multistick-P411038?keyword=multistick&amp;skuId=1855279&amp;_requestid=299579">Bite Beauty Multistick in Cocoa</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/themultistick">review here</a>). The colors are very similar and setting the liner with the powder shadow really locks it in place. </p>
<p>There you have it. You need this quad in your life! </p>
