<p>It's that time again! Grab yourself a cup of tea (or whatever you choose to drink at the moment) and listen to me babble on about something that's on my mind! </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Movement is a fact of life, as a living being. Even things that don't live, move. Our brains tell our muscles to move all day long. Some movements are calculated while others are so second nature they're almost involuntary. As humans, our lives are also constantly moving. We're leaving our houses each day to take on the world. We're moving to new apartments or into houses. We're moving in and out of relationships. </p>
<p>Movement is natural, it is expected, it is healthy. </p>
<p>Recently, I've made a big move. I've started a new role with a new company, moving on from the one I've called home the past few years. I've been extremely busy the last few weeks closing doors while opening new ones, and it's been pretty exhausting to say the least. Movement can be terrifying. I was with my old company for nearly three years. Those three years felt like three decades at times. I learned so much, I met so many talented people, and I made some lasting friendships. I was sad to make this move, it seemed daunting when the opportunity first arose. </p>
<p>Yet, it's all so exhilarating. I get to meet new people, take on new challenges, and grow as a human. I couldn't be more excited to try something new and step out of my comfort zone. I think I'm going to learn a ton and experience so many different people and projects, that I won't have a choice to be anything but happy with this move. </p>
<p>I'd like to let everyone who feels they might be stuck where they are, stuck with nowhere to move, that you dictate your own movements. Subconscious or not, they're your decisions. It's engrained in our being, to explore and seek out new knowledge and experiences—so don't deprive yourself of that. Not all movements are the best, but stagnancy is never the answer. You are strong, you are smart, and you can do it!</p>
