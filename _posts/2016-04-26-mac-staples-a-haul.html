<p>I had a bit of a stroll through the mac counter last week and while I told myself to stay strong, I caved a bit. Who’s surprised? Not me. To justify the spend a bit, I will say, I stuck to picking up some staples. I have tried mac products many times in the past, and always been pretty loyal to their brushes when I want to go high end. Who doesn’t own multiple 217’s?. Luckily, my local mac counter was only out of one of the items I had my eyes on, which is a rare occasion when you’re looking for their cult products! </p>
<p>I ended up picking up two lipsticks in the shades Patisserie and Velvet Teddy, one lip pencil in Soar, and one eye kohl in Teddy. </p>
<p>I’m not sure how much explanation any of these beauties require; but i’ll give it a quick stab anyhow. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13854/310/Products/Makeup/Lips/Lipstick/Lipstick#/shade/Patisserie"><em>Patisserie (Lustre):</em></a> This is a great everyday shade to have on hand for any makeup look. It’s a light peachy-pink with a bit of gold shimmer running through it. Since it’s a lustre finish it’s a bit more sheer and light. If you’re someone who likes to have a simple lip on rather than going bare—you’ll get a ton of use out of this one. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13854/310/Products/Makeup/Lips/Lipstick/Lipstick#/shade/Velvet_Teddy"><em>Velvet Teddy (Matte):</em></a> <em>Swoon.</em> On the matte side of the spectrum, this little number is my new obsession. It’s such a subtle muted beige color but it doesn’t wash me out like I was suspecting it might. The original matte formula from Mac is comfortable and long wearing. 5 stars from me!  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13852/340/Products/Makeup/Lips/Lip-Pencil/Lip-Pencil#/shade/Soar"><em>Soar:</em></a> As everyone else has this guy, I figured there was something to it. While it is a beautiful formula and great color, I feel like I have some way cheaper dupes in my collection. You might see a post about this soon. It’s pretty much the same color as my lips, so it goes well under most nude or pink shades for me. Definitely one I will get use out of, but might not spend the cash on it a second time. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13838/323/Products/Makeup/Eyes/Liner/Eye-Kohl#/shade/Teddy"><em>Teddy:</em></a> <em>Swoon again.</em> Another one I’ve been wearing since I brought this little loot home. If you have blue eyes—you need this eyeliner. A warm, dark, chocolatey brown with a bronze shimmer in it, it’s a dream for making lighter peepers really stand out. I like that it’s definitely a brown, but it’s still dark enough to create those classic smokey eye looks with. I’ve been lining my top eyelid with this and using a pencil brush to really blend it out. Then I either leave it at that or I’ll pop a champagne shade in the center of the eyelid to add to the dimension of the look. The wear time is wonderful and all around I’m very happy with this one.  </p>
<p>What are your favorites from Mac? Are there any other cult products of theirs I need in my life? <em>(hint: I'm sure there are) </em></p>
