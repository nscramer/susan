<p>Guys, my skin is being pretty weird lately. While I've gotten my breakouts completely under control (god bless my current skincare routine), I'm still struggling with some textural issues, as well as being more combo than ever. I've always had combo/oily skin, but not real dry patches. Lately, my cheeks and temples are like the Sahara desert. I can't figure it out! </p>
<p>While I'm working through that issue with different skincare products, I've also been testing out different foundations, both high end and drugstore. Most recently, I picked up the <a target="_blank" href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0172I87UC/ref=twister_B0172I848C?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1">Rimmel Match Perfection foundation</a>. I was originally drawn to this because I've been a long time lover of it's matching concealer, which is great for covering up those under-eye blues. The formula has a pretty standard liquid consistency, not super thin or thick. There's a pretty hefty scent, which is pretty standard for Rimmel— so if you're not a fan of that, beware. </p>
<p>I'm going to give this foundation a solid B. It does give a decent coverage, and doesn't cling to any dry patches. Also, the 101 Classic Ivory color is a great shade match for me. The points got knocked off when it came to blending. I felt like I spent <em>a lot</em> of time getting it to blend into my skin. When first applied, with both a brush and a sponge, it was just sitting on top of my skin and when trying to blend it just sort of moved around, but was still sitting on top. I found if you working in very thin layers and blend well, you can build this up to be both nicely blended and get a decent medium coverage. I did also feel like I had to set this with a powder, which I haven't been doing lately due to the dryer texture of my skin, so you can take that as a good or bad thing! </p>
<p>Overall, I'd recommend this to those who have pretty normal skin and want a light, dewey look for their base. </p>
<p>Have you tried this foundation? Are there any others you think I should try?</p>
