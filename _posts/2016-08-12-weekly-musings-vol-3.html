<p><br>You know the drill, here are some links to things i'm loving lately! </p>
<h3><strong>Reading</strong></h3>
<p><em>Just finished</em><br>*<a target="_blank" href="#">The Cursed Child:</a> As to be expected, I dropped everything when this finally showed up on my doorstep. It's such a quick read since there's only dialogue, so it's not a huge time commitment! It will fulfill all your extended Harry Potter story dreams. You must read.  </p>
<p><em>Currently reading</em><br>*<a target="_blank" href="#">Girlboss:</a> I’m totally late to the party on this one. I’m listening to the audiobook and I really love Sophia’s vibe and how open she is about her life experiences! </p>
<h3>
<strong>Listening</strong> </h3>
<p>I’ve been all about <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1c4rxrxy8eDLvMVL1DTiBe">Andra Day</a> lately! I first heard of her when she sang with Ellie Goulding, and I’ve been hooked ever since. Check out the tracks Forever Mine and Rise Up.</p>
<h3><strong>Swooning</strong></h3>
<p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw6uzNhWUA">tutorial from Shaanxo</a>, <em>#iwanttobeamoonchild</em><br>And, in turn, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/glow-kit-moonchild.html">Anastasia of Beverly Hills Moonchild Glow Kit</a></p>
<h3>
<strong>Trying</strong> </h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kaylaitsines.com/">#bbg</a> workouts. For the last year and a half, I’ve put exercise back toward the top of my priorities list. I rolled my eyes at this advice for years, but it really does make you a happier person. It’s science. Get high on those endorphins! I’ve only been doing this routine for 2 weeks, but I’m enjoying how quick and intense the HIIT style workouts are! You can feel accomplished and worn out all at the same time in only 28 mins. I will warn you—It’s hard! The goal for me is to do the 3 HIIT workouts a week, and then incorporate a traditional style weight lifting workout once a week. We’ll see how it goes!  </p>
