<p>Before you start thinking "Man Susan, first your planner a little late and now the mantra while we're already one month in? <em>sheesh."  </em>Hear me out—</p>
<p>I've never been one to hold onto one word the entire year, and I've never set formal resolutions. So this year I was going about my normal business when I ended up listening to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esteelalonde.com/">Estee Lalonde's</a> interview on the <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/fillerpodcast">Filler podcast</a>. I was really enjoying it, as expected, and I really loved the way Estee, Matt, and Harry talked about mindfulness in relation to different things in life. At a certain point, they said <em>"mindfulness is not bullshit"</em>. [sorry if the language offends you]</p>
<p>This really resonated with me. I've never been great at meditation, and I fall over a lot trying to do yoga. But I think that as these things become quite trendy and popular, it's even more important to remember that mindfulness is not limited to these things, nor are you an expert on it by attending a weekly session at a yoga studio. I think mindfulness can be applied to all things in life and practiced in many different ways. It's important to find what works for you.</p>
<p>I am going to try meditating more, likely by starting with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace's</a> take ten challenge. I can document that here if anyone is interested in how it goes!</p>
<p>I'd also like to just practice being present more. Seeing small things in a space, appreciating their presence. Listening much more intently in conversations and being involved at every moment.<br>I'm also going to work on being more mindful of my body. I've been feeling great with my current workout regime, but I need to work on my eating habits. I think that by being more mindful of what i'm eating but, more importantly, how I feel after eating different things, will be a step in the right direction. I also have some work to do on appreciating my features instead of trying to change them. I love playing with makeup and the way it can completely transform or simply enhance. But I need to stop being hard on myself, as I think most of us are, and just love what I have.</p>
<p>So no, I didn't start out with this mantra on January first, but when it came to me via that podcast, I decided to make it a constant in my life this year. To really be mindful. It's not just a fad, it's not a joke, it's not something people just talk about to be in the conversation. It's a life practice, and something I'd like to be better at. </p>
<p>Do you have a focus or mantra for 2016?</p>
