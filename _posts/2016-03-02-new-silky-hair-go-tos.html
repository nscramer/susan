<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1456849749646_43968">As I’ve talked about before, not too long ago I put my hair through some things. Lots of processing which completely dried it out worse than I’ve experienced before. I even had about four inches lopped off to take care of some of the damage. Now, this was entirely my own fault because I wanted that sleek grey hair! And I got it. And I loved it. For a short time :)</p>
<p>Since then, i’ve been on the hunt for the right products to repair my hair without overloading it. Before I went grey, my hair was actually quite limp, lifeless, and got greasy quite quickly. Post-grey, it's completely different. I'd still call it lifeless, but also dry as can be. </p>
<p>So, the new (ish) <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13762317" href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13762317">L’Oreal Extraordinary Oil</a> range is a great option for me! I’ve been testing out the shampoo, conditioner, and serum for about a week, and I am overall pretty pleased with these products! </p>
<p>First off, they smell <em>so good</em>. Secondly, they really hydrate and replenish my hair without causing any buildup or greasiness. </p>
<p>The Lustrous Oil Serum is by far my favorite item from the range, as hair serums/oils are a staple product for me. If you do a lot of heat styling with your hair—you’ve got to start using oils, they’ll change your hair! </p>
<p>This oil has helped a <em>ton</em> with the ends of my hair, I apply a hefty amount to the ends before blow-drying, and any excess left on my hands i’ll run lightly through the roots. My hair would be in complete shambles without a product like this. </p>
<p>The conditioner comes in second for me; as I see it as a great conditioner but it didn’t really wow me. I am really finicky with conditioners, and honestly tend to use masks a lot instead. But I will definitely be using this up as my regular conditioner option! </p>
<p>And in third place from what i’ve tried, the shampoo. This really isn’t to do with the product, I think it leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. However, I do have very cool-toned, ashy blonde hair, so I prefer to use a deep violet toning shampoo to keep any and all warmth from creeping into my locks. </p>
<p>Overall, if you’re struggling with dry, hard to manage hair—I think this range will be great for you! The smell is great, and you’ll have silky hair in no time!</p>
