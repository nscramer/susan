<p>Like many other people, I am one who really enjoys a good book. I like to be immersed in a world that is not my own, learn more about who people are and how they function, and find characters I can really root for. </p>
<p>Many of my favorite books have been around for quite some time. I will pick up a Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Austen before looking at any new read that’s hit the NYT Bestsellers list. This led me to start up a hobby I wasn’t entirely sure was there until it was pointed out to me—I have a thing for collecting different editions of my favorite books. I am drawn in to cover art I’ve not seen before, Penguin does some of my favorites and they're always coming out with new collections to please the eye of classic readers! Now, I still have the same ratty copies of my favorites that I’ve had since the beginning, but I do stay on the lookout for new editions to add to my collection. </p>
<p>Now that my boyfriend has pointed this habit of collecting to me, I think it's something i'll try to do more consciously. I've <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog//winter-lip-loves-and-a-blast-of-nostalgia"><em>spoken previously about my love for Pride and Prejudice</em></a>, and I'm definitely interested in a few more editions of it that i've seen around, and there's always those <em><a target="_blank" href="#">ever so dreamy editions of a few Fitzgerald novels</a>.</em> </p>
<p>If you come to my home, you'll find books <em>everywhere</em>. These comes from both of us—we're book hoarders. We've got large bookshelves and piles on every open surface. I love to decorate with stacks of books, and I do rotate them around every now and again. I just feel more comfortable with books around, you really can't trust people who don't have any laying around their home—am I right?! :) </p>
<p>What do you like to collect?</p>
