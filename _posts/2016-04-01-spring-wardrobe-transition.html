<p>Leather jacket- as I like to say, adding a leather jacket to any outfit instantly doubles your badass points. It’s the perfect “i’m professional, but not too professional” touch. You’ll look grown up but still young and carefree. Shop my favorite options <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zara.com/us/en/woman/outerwear/jackets/faux-leather-jacket-c798508p3275514.html">here</a> (steal), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zara.com/us/en/woman/outerwear/jackets/leather-biker-jacket-c798508p3233177.html">here</a> (invest), and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.madewell.com/madewell_category/AllProducts/PRDOVR~B0648/B0648.jsp">here</a> (splurge).</p>

<p>Denim jacket- a recent “shop my closet” discovery has been my denim jacket. When I first purchased this a few years ago, I struggled to find my jam with it, yet I couldn’t let it go. I’m very glad I kept it because this spring I have so many outfits planned for it! I like the way it looks over just about any kind of top, or tied around the waist over a relaxed fit t-shirt.

<p>Distressed jean- this style goes in and out, but for me it’s pretty much always in. I’m a huge self proclaimed spokesperson for the Topshop Jamie Jeans, specifically the ones with distressed details. I think it adds a touch of personality to an otherwise plain bottom half. Get these jeans <a target="_blank" href="http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/category/clothing-427/jeans-446/jamie-skinny-jeans-4300112/N-87gZdgl?No=0&amp;Nrpp=20&amp;siteId=%2F12556&amp;geoip=noredirect">here</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/topshop-jeans">here</a>.</p>

<p>Neutral sneakers- sneakers are the way, my friends. It’s something the Europeans have had down pat for years, but it’s finally starting to surface in the US. I have to admit, sneakers are my favorite footwear. There, I said it, it’s out there. I restrain myself when shopping so that I don’t end up with too many, but they just make your outfit look so effortless. If you are looking for a one pair fits all deal, I’d suggest some with a neutral palette like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/ingoodcompany/newbalance/PRDOVR~06690/06690.jsp?color_name=Gold-Salt&amp;srcCode=GGBS00006_99103754803_200317638_15965730078_18283950120_c_pla&amp;sisearchengine=197&amp;siproduct=06690&amp;noPopUp=true&amp;source=googlePLA&amp;gclid=CLfqxqXE18sCFQckhgodR7cOog&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">these </a>or <a target="_blank" href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/roshe-one-shoe/pid-1604847/pgid-1535720">these</a>.</p>
