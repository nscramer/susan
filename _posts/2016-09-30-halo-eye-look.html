<p>I think I've mentioned before that i'm quite the YouTube junkie. I can spend hours watching tutorial after tutorial. The gals + guys in the YouTube beauty community are so talented! A look I see people create often is the 'halo eye' where you have a deeper shade on the inner and outer corners of the eye, with a lighter shade in the center. This look can make your eyes look bigger and rounder, and it just looks really cool! </p>
<p>I recently repurchased an old drugstore fav: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L51ET8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedeskofsusa-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B007L51ET8&amp;linkId=6d7101a841b5c5cc8e999570685176ee">Wet + Wild Comfort Zone</a> palette. This baby has had it's fair share of the spot light, and I think is most famous for a shade which is pretty close to Mac's Club eyeshadow. I've used that shade (something that looks kind of scary in the pan) in this look, and I don't find it overwhelming at all! </p>
<p>The shade in question, the 'definer' shade in the bottom right of the palette, is a deep brown color with a bright blue shift. The blue only catches in certain lights, which really gives the look some edge without being too out there. I took this shade on the inner and outer corners of the lids, and then blended it out through the crease. From there I took the 'browbone' shade in the top left and mixed it with the 'lid' shade just underneath it to place on the center of the eyelids. Blending is key here, so be sure to go in with a fluffy brush that doesn't have any product on it to blend seamlessly. </p>
<p>To finish off the eyes I took the brown 'crease' shade (left) and smudged it in along the lash line before piling on the mascara (as usual). What do you think? Is this something you would wear? It turned out way less dramatic than I expected—and I'm really enjoying it! </p>
