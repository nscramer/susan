<p>Last week, I was looking for a new, longer lasting nail option for a weekend away. I really didn’t want to tote along my nail polish choice and remover in case of some massive chip (a usual for me). Also, I’m a bit jealous of all the people who get shellac, but i’m way too weary to get it done myself. As someone who has the nails that are still showing the years of acrylics, anything that involves that electric buffer roughing up the surface of my nails has me running the other direction. I’m talking I haven’t had acrylic nails on in close to 7 years, and you can <em>still</em> see the ridges in my nails. </p>
<p>So, I stick to the plain ole polish and deal with removing and re-painting every few days. </p>
<p>When I happened upon the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/gel-couture?productId=xlsImpprod14371015&amp;cmpid=PS_Non!google!Nail_Essie&amp;CAWELAID=330000200000686556&amp;CAPCID=105207665310&amp;cadevice=c&amp;agid=30936291990&amp;catci=kwd-170533702818&amp;gclid=CJjup8KC-M0CFQiQaQod4aQJjg#">Essie Gel Couture</a> line in my local drugstore I was instantly drawn in. Not only is the packaging a very cool twist (get it? HA!) on their original bottles, but they killed it with the color selection. I picked up the purple-y grey shade called Take Me To Thread. </p>
<p>Guys—this stuff is legit! It claims to have up to 14 day wear. Now, I don’t know about that exactly. When you type a lot your nails wear down faster, it’s just a thing. But this did last beautifully for 7 solid days. On the 7th day it had only chipped slightly on one nail. ONE NAIL! I filed that sucker down and was good to go. To have a nail polish even last 3 days with zero chips on my nails is a miracle. </p>
