<p>I wanted to do a wrap-up style post, but locking into a weekly cadence seemed like I could end up scraping around for things to talk about when I had a rather boring week. Which, let’s be honest, happens quite often. So, the cadence for this series will be much more broad, and i’m thinking at least once a month will be good, or maybe more if there’s a lot going on.<br>I want this series to be more about what's on my mind in the given time, rather than always have a specific topic. I’d like to share articles I happened upon that I think are worth a read, books i’ve finished or started, my opinion on current events, and other sources of inspiration for my life and my work.</p>
<p><strong>To read:</strong> If your workplace uses any sort of instant messaging software for communication, I think you’ll enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.m3ip5q3pz">this article</a>. While it’s a longer read, there are some excellent points on how this can actually diminish the productivity of employees if used poorly—definitely a different perspective than most out there on the topic!</p>
<p>Also, <a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Flower-Workshop-Arranging-Branches-Materials/dp/1607747650?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;ref_=tmm_hrd_swatch_0&amp;sr=">this book</a> has given me a need to bring more blooms into my life. I have a bit of space for planters at the new house, so I'm excited to delve into the world of gardening a bit. Expect photos and posts to come this spring + summer!</p>
<p><strong>To view:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://afflante.com/23820-wonderful-italian-villa-renovation/">This interior</a>.  Major swoon. The bright whites and mixes of woods. It’s so dreamy.</p>
<p><strong>To try:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://minimalistbaker.com/better-than-restaurant-falafel-vegan-gluten-free/">This falafel recipe</a>. I made this on sunday to have for my lunches this week, and I definitely snuck one right after they were done—so yummy! Now, they didn’t come out as pretty as I’d hoped, but luckily they taste the same no matter the shape!</p>
<p><strong>To add to the wish list:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charlottetilbury.com/us/new-instant-look-in-a-palette-makeup-palette">This beautiful piece of makeup art.</a> I have a feeling I won’t be able to hold out too long on this one. I mean, would ya look at it?</p>
