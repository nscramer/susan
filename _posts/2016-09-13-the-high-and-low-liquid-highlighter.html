<p>Let's be real—the highlighter category is becoming <em>quite </em>saturated. Every brand releases shade after shade, each rising in intensity, for all of us to give our complexions a glow that can be seen from the space station. </p>
<p>The other aspect is the different forms of highlighter. Today, I'm going to share with you the only two <strong>liquid highlighters</strong> which I think you need. </p>
<p>We'll start on the low end and work our way up: The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/born-glow-liquid-illuminator?productId=xlsImpprod5050023#">NYX Born To Glow Liquid Illuminator in Sunbeam</a>. This is a gorgeous pinky-toned glow that can be worn quite subtle or built up to the level of the photos you see on Instagram. This shade works well for us paler-skinned ladies, and they have three other shades so most should be able to find one that suits them! You can find this at Ulta and most Target stores these days—for under $8! </p>
<p>The high end option is by BECCA, did you expect anything different? BECCA is known for owning the highlighter game when it first became a thing. From their original shades to their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/review-becca-x-jaclyn-hill-split-pans">collaborations with Jacklyn Hill</a>, they've been the go-to for glow giving products for a while. While their powders actually aren't my favorite (I feel they really emphasize texture), nothing beats the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/shimmering-skin-perfector?productId=xlsImpprod10921070">Liquid Shimmering Skin Perfecter in Moonstone</a>. The shade matches my skin wonderfully, and their shade range is pretty large. The liquid formula of these highlights is a bit more subtle than the other forms, but it can still be built up nicely. This is my most used highlighter. To make it even better—I buy the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/travel-size-shimmering-skin-perfector?productId=xlsImpprod11621005#">travel size</a>, which is only $19, and it takes me <em>forever</em> to go through it. Aka, I'm still working on my first tube. Definitely a great option if you don't think you'd use up the big one before it expires! </p>
<p>Do you use either of these? Are there other top contenders I should check out?</p>
