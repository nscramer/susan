<p><em><em><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Ole-Henriksen-Ultimate-Lift-Roll-/dp/B00871DNU8/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461075584&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ole+henriksen+ultimate+lift+eye+gel">Ole Henricksen Ultimate Lift Eye Gel Roll On</a></em></em>—This was a great find at my local TJ Maxx! Whenever i’m there I scour the cosmetics and skincare aisles for gems like this. (don’t worry, this doesn’t mean it’s hard to get—you can find it on amazon!) I scored this for around $10, and I really like it! The roller ball is soon nice and cooling. I’d be lying if I said I’d love just the metal roller ball even if there wasn’t a nice eye gel in there as well! The gel itself is so light and refreshing. I only use this in the mornings, and I find it really helps my eye bags, helping me to look less like I haven’t slept in 5 years. If you can get ahold of this one—I highly recommend it! </p>
<p><em><a target="_blank" href="http://smile.amazon.com/Milani-Prime-Shield-Face-Primer/dp/B01BPLBFGK/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?rps=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461075533&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=milani+prime+shield">Milani Prime Shield (mattifying and pore-minimizing)</a></em>—I picked up this primer thinking it could be similar to something like the Smashbox photo finish primer, which I’ve always enjoyed. I know some people really aren’t into the silicone-feel primers, but personally I love them! These formulas do a great job of filling in my larger pores and smoothing out my skin. I had high hopes for this Milani offering, as most of their products which I’ve tried have pleasantly surprised me. <br>I’ve been trying this one out for a few weeks and I’m still kind of <em>“meh”</em> about it, really. I’ll likely use it up, as I find my foundation applies nicely overtop, and it does smooth out some of the texture in my skin. However, in comparison to similar formulas, I find it a bit oily in texture. Also, it’s meant to mattify oily skin and while it helped a bit around my nose, my forehead ended up much more oily by the end of the day than normal. <br>I also can’t say that it helped my makeup last any longer, but I wasn’t necessarily expecting that, that’s what setting sprays are for!<br>All in all, I think it’s a good option for smoothing the skin, but not for oil control. As I said, i’ll probably use this up, or pass it on to a friend with slightly drier skin than mine.  </p>
