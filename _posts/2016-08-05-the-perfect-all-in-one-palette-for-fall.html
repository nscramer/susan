<p>I know what you’re thinking—Susan, don’t wish Summer away so quickly! </p>
<p>I could say I’m not trying to, but that might be a lie. It’s been a hot and humid one in the Midwest, and I’m so ready for the cool breeze of Fall. </p>
<p>I’m bringing this to you in August, however, because now’s your chance to get your hands on your perfect all in one palette to use this fall. This is the <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/lorac-refined-romance-eye-cheek-palette-30-value/4408625">Lorac Refined Romance palette</a>, created for this year’s Nordstrom Anniversary Sale. Meaning, I believe you can only get this before August 8th. See why I’m bringing up Fall so early? </p>

<p>Now, for starters, the packaging of this product is kind of <em>meh</em> for me. I love florals, but I love the sleek, simple looks of Lorac’s other palettes. Getting inside this bad boy, however, makes the cover nothing to think about. You’ve got 6 shadows, in a perfect color combo for fall. A nice shimmery white, a gold shimmer, and a garnet shimmer occupy the top row. Then you have the perfect matte light brown, a satin taupe like color, and a matte garnet shade. I’m pretty much obsessed with these color choices. You may even catch me wearing some more fall inspired looks in August, because I love the colors so much. You can create many different looks, and the combo of matte and shimmer gives you everything you need. </p>
<p>Moving over to the cheeky side of things, the palette has two highlighters, one a pale champagne color and one a bit pinky, and a beautiful dusty rose matte blush. For starters, this is the blush shade i’m most drawn to in the cooler months, so that’s an instant win. The highlighters, while I am not sure how to wear the pink one just yet, are very pretty as well. They’re not as pigmented as I expected, being Lorac, but they build up really nicely. I think i’ll end up using the pink shade as either eyeshadow or mix it in with the blush shade to create a more luminous flush to the cheeks. </p>

<p>Formula-wise, the eyeshadows technically aren’t their “Pro” formula. However, I think they’re just as good. Everything is very pigmented as you’d expect and blend easily. The shimmers pack a punch and the mattes aren’t chalky or patchy. </p>
<p>I can say the same for the blush, formula is nice, color payoff is good, blends well. And since I mentioned the highlight formula above, that covers it! </p>
<p>This beauty will definitely be traveling with me, and help me cut way down on the amount of products taken on a trip. It’s a great multiple use product, and a hell of a deal! Check it out! </p>
