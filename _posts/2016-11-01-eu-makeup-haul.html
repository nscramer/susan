<p>You had to guess I was going to do a bit of makeup shopping whilst across the pond, right? Luckily, it was the more inexpensive products I was after. Being able to walk into a Kiko store was so exciting! I could have purchased so much more but honestly, I did get a bit overwhelmed. However, the process of building my Inglot palette might go down as when I was the most indecisive I've ever been (sorry, Nick). </p>
<p>But, I'll cut to the chase. Here's what I got! </p>

<p>From Kiko:<br>Water Eyeshadow in 200: This is quite possibly the most beautiful eyeshadow I own. I mean, would ya look at it?! It's a perfect mid-toned bronze shade that's not too gold and not too brown. Also, it's metallic power is strong. Dry, it adds a wonderful sparkle, and wet, the intensity is really kicked up. I highly recommend this product! </p>
<p>Extra Sculpt Volume Mascara: I knew I had to grab this because I've heard Kathleen Lights rave about it so much. If I'm being honest, however, I'm not <em>that</em> impressed. It does give some great volume. The formula is definitely something I can get behind. For me, the wand is where the problems are. It's <strong>huge</strong>. So, so big. Also, the hourglass shape confuses me a bit because it means i'm putting one of the widest points of the wand into the inner corner—one of the smallest spaces of my eyes. I just found it a bit messy. I have to be light handed and move pretty slowly to avoid getting this all over my face. It could be user error, but it's not my favorite. </p>
<p>From  Inglot: <br>Walking up to the products, I knew I was going to have to make my own palette. I decided that 5 shadows would be a good place to start! I also knew that I wanted to grab one of their sculpting powders...which snowballed into the pretty little blush that also made it's way into my bag. Here's the shades:</p>
<p><em>Eyeshadows</em><br>#35 White, shimmery color for highlighting brow bone + inner corners. <br>#357 Matte transition shade, the perfect mid-toned brown!<br>#154 Shimmery, metallic bronze. Hello, my go-to eyeshadow. <br>#335 Matte burnt-orange &amp; #299 Matte burgundy:  I stepped out of my box a bit with these two, and I'm so glad I did! I really love using these shades for some autumnal color in an eye look. I never thought I would like such warm shades on my complexion, but I stand corrected! <br>I did notice I need to use an eye primer with these shadows. </p>
<p>Sculpting powder: #505, a perfect shade for my pale Fall + Winter skin. <br>Blush: #55 . This is a very cool toned pinky-mauve which is fitting for the cooler months! It gives a gorgeous flush of color to the face. </p>
<p>Have you tried either of these brands?</p>
