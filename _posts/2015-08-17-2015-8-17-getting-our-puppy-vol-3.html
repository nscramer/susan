<p>He's home! He's a sweet, energetic, loving ball of fur. <br>While I love him very much and even at this point wouldn’t ever want to not have him, he’s a lot of work. <em>A lot.</em> <br>He does well in his crate, although he doesn’t quite see it as his safe place like we want him to feel in the future. He’s not house broken, so we’re working on that the best we can. Which involves taking him out every 4 hours at least. If he’s just eaten or had water, he goes out more frequently. It’s a big schedule change for us, to make sure we’re home to do these things as needed. <br>In addition, we’re training him till he’s ready to go to a puppy class. He's so smart and really seems to enjoy going through commands with us! He has an evaluation in the coming days with a trainer so we can get him into a class. </p>
<p>The first few weeks are definitely about getting to know each other, and testing each other. He’s testing us, and we are trying to test him as well. This process is not without it’s stress and the occasional stretch of sanity, but I know that it will be more than worth it. </p>
<p>The thing about getting a puppy is it’s an investment. You choose to get a puppy instead of a grown dog so you can raise it yourself and train it or have it trained the way you’d like. All of the hard work now will pay off ten fold when Fitz is a well behaved dog who still loves to have fun with us. (well, that’s the plan :) ) </p>
<p>He's very lovable and <em>so</em> chill. Sure, he has his bursts of energy and speeds around the house, but he's overall very calm for a puppy. We are loving having him around, and now that we are falling into a better rhythm with caring for him the "new parent" stress is lightening up. </p>
<p>Here's a shot of our stud I snapped over the weekend:  </p>
