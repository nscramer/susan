<p>It's been a while since I've given you a peek into my everyday makeup stash by telling you what products I can't stop using in recent weeks—so here we are! Let me know if there's anything you've been loving that I should try! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/silky-touch-blush?productId=xlsImpprod2670073#"><em>Essence Silky Touch Blush in Adorable</em></a><br>This might look like your basic pink blush. And honestly, it is. But that’s why it’s great! It was $2.99, and the quality is great. It has the slightest bit of sheen once it’s applied to the cheeks. It might just be the most natural blush I’ve ever worn! I definitely think if you’re looking for a staple blush that’s good quality <em>and</em> a steal, this is the ticket! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/your-skin-but-better-cc-cream-with-spf-50?productId=xlsImpprod5770257"><em>It Cosmetics CC Cream</em></a><br>This beautiful product doesn’t need much of an explanation, you already know! It’s a lovely product that provides nice coverage, a gorgeous finish, and so many skin benefits! I currently am using the travel size in the shade Light, as my tube of Fair is a <em>touch</em> too light for me right now. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/superstay-better-skin-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod12651007"><em>Maybeline Better Skin Concealer</em></a><br>A newer option from maybeline, this concealer has been lovely for my dry, crepe-like under eyes. I’ve been testing out a few different day-time eye creams, and one really dried out my skin under the peepers. Since then, I’ve had to put away some of my favorite concealers that are a bit thicker (NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer has been benched), and this pretty tube of delight has subbed in. It’s not the most full coverage option, but it is very lightweight, bendable, and it doesn’t suck the life out of my under eyes. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/marvelous-moxie-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod5320039#"><em>Bare Minerals Marvelous Moxie lipstick in Take Charge</em></a><br>Such a great nude! It looks a bit pinky-orange in the bullet, but comes out as close to a true nude as I will get on the lips. It’s creamy, so it doesn’t last a particularly long amount of time, but it’s so easy to apply, even without a mirror, that I don’t mind donning it on a night out. I wore this to my 25th birthday celebrations with a champagne and bronze eye look + lots of highlighter, and I’ve been kind of hooked since! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://colourpop.com/collections/creme-gel-liner-1/products/over-board-liner"><em>Colourpop creme gel eyeliner in Over Board</em></a><br>These eyeliners. WOW. Incredibly pigmented, blend beautifully, last all day! What more could you ask for in a liner? <em>And</em> they offer so many different colors! I secretly have a periwinkle blue number stored away that I haven’t been brave enough to wear yet. I use this shade, overboard, a warm bronze shade to line the upper lash line then smudge it in with my finger. I also love using this to tight line because it give some depth without being too harsh. Did I mention this is $5? I can’t wait to pick up more of these!  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://colourpop.com/collections/brows/products/blondie"><em>Colourpop brow pomade in Blondie</em></a><br>I've spoken about the Colourpop <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeskofsusan.com/blog/5-inexpensive-products-you-cant-afford-to-miss">brow products before,</a> initially I used the pencil a ton. It's affordable and I really liked the product, but I went through it <em>very </em>quickly. I had picked up this pomade at the same time, and originally thought it was a bit much for my brows, but I've fallen in love with it over the last few weeks! You have to take a light hand with it, but you really can create a natural brow look. I use an Anastasia of Beverly Hills dual-ended brow brush that has a very precise angled brush on one side and a spooly on the other to apply. I love to go natural for an everyday look and really build it up if I am feeling a bold-brow day. </p>
