<p>Due to the nature of my job, and just a general interest in the topic, I do a lot of reading in my free time around productivity and motivation. When you're pulling long, intense hours in front of a screen where every minute in your work day is a whirlwind, it's nice to know there are ways to improve the work you're doing. I've noticed that many, many other folks who work in similar situations can say the same. I'm explaining this because it leads me to try out <em>a ton</em> different types of sounds to listen to while working. Ambient sounds, upbeat music, chill music, instrumentals.<br>The other thing about my work life—we have an open office space. We're one big family in one big room, working on different tasks that will drive us toward our common goals. Sounds peachy-keen, right? It can be <em>very cool. </em>And most of the time, it is. However, there are times when the hustle and bustle can be too much, and it's hard to focus on the task or project at hand. <br>When that happens, I retreat into my headphones, turn on a great playlist, ambient noises that help me relax and focus, or a combination of both. </p>

<p>I also work from home a day or two each week, but the silence can also turn out to be a deterrent from productivity as well! </p>
<p>Since ambient sound is probably more abstract to some, i'll start there. I've tried out a number of different apps that do this, and have many different sounds to choose from. The one i've become loyal to is called <a target="_blank" href="http://noiz.io/">Noiz.io</a>. This is an app for Macs, and it's downright fabulous. With sounds like beach waves, campfire, summer night, Paris cafe, etc. i'm sure you'd be in agreement that there's something for everyone. Another great thing about this app—you can layer the sounds on top of each other, and adjust the volume for each so you can make one more prominent than others. Right now, i've been rocking the oh-so-wonderful combo of beach waves and sunny day. I may or may not be chalking it up to "preparing" myself for my upcoming trip. With this combo, the waves slowly roll in all day, with birds chirping in the background. I also love a good dose of Paris Cafe with, well, <em>any</em> other choices. Who doesn't want to feel like they're in Paris?</p>
<p>My other major source of sound at work (and during all other times of life) are <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> playlists. Spotify is the bomb. It's just that simple. While you don't <em>have</em> to pay for the premium version, I do highly suggest it, as it makes life so much easier. My favorite part of Spotify premium is the ability to save offline music. This means you can listen to those songs and lists <em>without</em> wifi or using data. It's basically how I survive going for runs, since I don't like to use my data service. (anyone else feel like they go through that standard 2 gigs <strong>super</strong> quick?) <br>Here's some of my go-to playlists: </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/seaosgood/playlist/14TXtv3ViBe2j9x43XMOzv">Current</a> : this is a personal list, curated by yours truly. This list basically sums up my mood at any given moment. I am constantly adding—and removing—songs from here based on what i'm jamming to. I'll also throw new/popular songs on there to make sure I give them a listen. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/1B9o7mER9kfxbmsRH9ko4z">Feelin' Good</a> : this list is curated by Spotify, old tunes that do just as it says—make you feel good. I'm a sucker for this type of music. Who doesn't like to feel good? </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="spotify:user:spotify:playlist:63dDpdoVHvx5RkK87g4LKk">Peaceful piano</a> : this one is also curated by Spotify, and consists of Piano instrumentals. If you're not a fan of that type of music, you might want to skip this one (and maybe the next as well). I find sometimes when I need to seriously focus, music with lyrics distracts me. The piano puts me at east and lets me get down to business. This list has some very popular tunes that everyone is pretty much guaranteed to know, so that's a plus! </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/5O2ERf8kAYARVVdfCKZ9G7">Coffee table jazz</a> : another (you guessed it) curated by Spotify. They are seriously <em>so good </em>at creating lists. Which I guess is a given being in that biz? Probably. Anywho, if you're not a fan of jazz, I seriously don't know how to help you. Kidding. I've always been a lover of this music, and it just instantly lifts my spirits. Again with no lyrics, cause that's just how I like it sometimes. </p>
<p><em>What sounds and music to you listen to at work?</em></p>
