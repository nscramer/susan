<h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Voice and Tone for Ahalogy</h2>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ahalogy had a problem. We weren’t communicating in the same way across all functions. Whether it was product features, how our service works, etc., we were all over the place. Different functions in the business even called the same features by different names. Essentially, we were in need of a way to unify our communication.  </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I took a personal interest in this and began to research what other companies which have a really strong voice. Specifically Buffer, Pinterest, and Mailchimp. Each of these companies has a voice that is recognizable across many different types of communication, undoubtedly authored by multiple people. The priority they’ve put on voice as a pillar of their brand inspired me and led to me create this for Ahalogy.  </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Research began into what Ahalogy has been to date, how we want to portray ourselves in the market, and what information was needed to get us there—on the same page. With my background in communication focussing on how people who work together communicate combined with my love of grammar, I was able to create Ahalogy’s Voice and Tone Guide. </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Voice and Tone guide is a collection of guidelines on different communication types for all functions dependent upon the intended audience. It was also requested that I provide some helpful tips on common grammatical errors, some of which are stylistic choices.  </p>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Voice is a pillar to any brand and it was an impactful project to spearhead. Working cross functionally is the best way to not only get the right inputs for a project like this, but to ensure quick buy-in and adoption of a new way of working.  </p>
