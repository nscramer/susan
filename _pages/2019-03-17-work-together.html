<h1 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Let's collaborate. </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">I do a few things. Write, strategize, research, take photos, listen, observe, and act. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">I help brands define their voice, tone, and writing style. I help brands use <br>those elements to build an identity, a personality. <br>I apply those same elements in copy for blogs, social media, marketing collateral, <br>websites, and more. I research things, too. <br>I can help you define and analyze your audience to build personas and user journeys. <br>Need someone who can manage these projects as well as execute the work? I’m your gal.<br>Together, we can make sure your brand is creating and nurturing <br>meaningful relationships with your customers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>As your brand wouldn't exist without you, the beginning of our efforts will be highly collaborative as I get to know the in's and out's of what it means for your brand to be successful. </em></p>
