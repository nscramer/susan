<h1 class="text-align-center">30 BEFORE 25</h1>
<p>When I graduated college I was 21, bright eyed, and ambitious. I wasn't <em>exactly</em> sure what I wanted to do with my career, but I knew I wanted to make an impact on the world somehow. I've since put a lot of time and effort into learning about myself, my strengths, and what would make me happy in work. <br>This list, however, is (mostly) about things outside of work. My passions that i'd like to get into as hobbies (serious lack of a better term). It's places I'd like to visit, accomplishments i'd like to check off, skills and interests i'd like to keep up that might not be part of my day job. It's evolved some with me over the past 3 years, as I expected it to. I've evolved a lot in the last three years as well, so it only makes sense the list does so with me.</p>
<p>I know tons of these types of lists float around the blogosphere and I've been jotting down goals to include in mine here &amp; there. When making a list of goals there are a few important things I think everyone should keep in mind:<br>1. A timeline.<br>If you don't give yourself a deadline to have the goal accomplished, you'll be surprised at how fast it can get pushed to the back of your mind due to all of the other crazy things that go on in life.<br>2. Personalization.<br>This seems obvious, but it's seriously important to truthfully feel that each item on your list is tailored to you. Including that deadline I just mentioned.<br>3. Fun.<br>Make sure you put some light hearted, fun goals on your list too! You don't want to be all work and no play. Plus, if you load yourself up with all serious goals, it's going to seem more like a chore.</p>
